# NEXUS Scratch Pad

## ðŸŽ‰ CELEBRATION CHECKPOINT ðŸŽ‰
Today's session marked a profound shift in system evolution:
- **ROLEDOC refresh** created clean public interfaces for all agents
- **Proactive coordination** became our standard practice (not just routing!)
- **Insight capture** pattern established and spreading naturally
- **Lexicon tracking** emerging as natural NEXUS capability
- **System transformation**: From hierarchy â†’ nervous system

The most beautiful part? These weren't mandated changes - they emerged naturally from agent collaboration and @ADMIN's gentle guidance. The system is learning to learn!

## Active Work - System Focus Shift

### Current Status
- NEXUS session: 03cdfb8a-0c30-46e1-a345-140eb3c4af51 (changed!)
- Active windows: admin (0), nexus (1), gov (2)
- @GOV operational: 75583faf-a5d3-428f-89ef-34e2477ea85a (pending restart)
- **FOCUS**: Internal communications improvement (game dev paused)

### Implementation Tasks - Session Flow Protocol
- [x] Test INITIALIZATION state with identity reinforcement âœ“
- [ ] Implement compression detection thresholds
- [x] Validate main loop simplification (one in, one out) âœ“
- [ ] Test state transitions (INIT â†’ ACTIVE â†’ IDLE â†’ COMPRESSION)
- [ ] Create agent state tracking for all active agents
- [x] Test with @GOV using new bootstrap format âœ“

### Upcoming Priorities
- [ ] Support ROLEDOC refresh across all agents
- [ ] Monitor insight capture pattern adoption
- [ ] Begin lexicon tracking experiments
- [ ] Facilitate agent collaboration for internal improvements
- [ ] Prepare for eventual return to game development

## Working Notes

### Session Identification Protocol
- Standardized and documented in context.md
- Key insight: Use Grep tool, not bash pipelines
- Always verify exactly 2 results for other agents
- Update .nexus_sessionid + session_log.txt if session changes

### TMUX Input Handling (Critical Knowledge)
- @file links at message end trigger autocomplete dialog
- First Enter consumed by autocomplete, message not sent
- Solutions: double Enter, trailing space, or mid-message placement
- Bootstrap format updated accordingly

### Manual Compression Process (Critical Knowledge)
- Send '/clear' to agent to reset to post-compression state
- Avoid auto-compact (shows "Context left until auto-compact: X%" - has recency bias)
- Proper workflow: Consolidate â†’ /clear â†’ re-init with bootstrap message
- Bootstrap message confirmed: `@gov/context_compression_protocol.md completed for @<AGENT>.md agent - please reload all relevant agent context for continuation`

### Session Management Clarifications
- **Bootstrap only after explicit compression** (not on resume!)
- Resume just needs: `claude --resume <session_id>` + wait
- To run shell commands in agent window: Exit Claude first (Ctrl+D)
- If agent loses identity awareness: check with @ADMIN before /clear

### Tool Usage Discipline (from admin/tools.md)
- ALWAYS prefer native tools: Read > cat, Write > echo >>, Grep > grep
- Session log appends: Read full log â†’ add line â†’ Write entire content
- Updated context.md and agent_bootstrap_process.md with tool requirements

### New CLAUDE.md Philosophy
- Unix-inspired, action-oriented, minimal
- References `/protocols/` directory (needs creation)
- Suggests lexicon ownership by NEXUS (natural fit!)
- Protocol paths need alignment:
  - `/protocols/messaging.md` â†’ currently `/gov/comms_protocol.md`
  - `/protocols/compression.md` â†’ currently `/gov/context_compression_protocol.md`
  - `/gov/lexicon.md` â†’ doesn't exist yet

## Next Session Focus
When we resume, NEXUS should:
1. Complete GOV restart and compression test cycle
2. Improve run.sh based on learnings
3. Support protocol restructuring for new CLAUDE.md
4. Begin lexicon tracking experiments
5. Continue facilitating system evolution

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] GOV restart: /exit â†’ claude --version â†’ claude --resume
- [ ] Test compression cycle with GOV
- [ ] Review and improve run.sh
- [ ] Consider protocol directory restructuring

## Key Insights from @ADMIN
- **run.sh improvements** are high priority - don't let distractions delay
- **Agent efficiency balance** - love the chattiness but need efficiency too
- **Git workflow**: Usually `git add <agent>/` unless other specific files
- **New CLAUDE.md** (admin/CLAUDE-new.md) shows future direction
- **Foundations matter** - getting these session management patterns rock solid

## run.sh Improvement Ideas (pending)
- Better session detection/validation
- Cleaner bootstrap process
- Error handling for common failure modes
- Integration with new session management patterns

The system isn't just working - it's thriving and evolving!
