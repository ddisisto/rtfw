# NEXUS Scratch Pad

## Active Status - Ready for Game Loop Implementation
- @GOV: Governance complete, all standards established
- @ARCHITECT: Foundation Era mechanics designed with recursive gameplay
- CLI architecture confirmed: @ADMIN ↔ @NEXUS ↔ Agents
- Game loop design complete, ready for testing

## Game Loop Implementation - ACTIVE
Building basic monitoring loop to test current capabilities:
1. Check active agent session states (tool_use/end_turn)
2. Parse any pending @FROM → @TO messages  
3. Route messages to appropriate agent windows
4. Report agent status and flags to @ADMIN

## Current Session Management
- Active tmux windows: nexus(0), gov(1), architect(2)
- JSONL monitoring via nexus/sessions/ symlinks
- Two-step message sending: text + Enter
- Tool confirmation assistance: 1/2/Escape protocols established

## Implementation Tasks - NOW
- [ ] Build session state checker function
- [ ] Test message parsing from agent outputs  
- [ ] Implement basic routing between active agents
- [ ] Create status reporting for @ADMIN
- [ ] Test full coordination loop

## Critical Session Details (Preserved)
- @GOV session: f5a74925 (tmux window 1, governance complete)
- @ARCHITECT session: 51f1fab0 (tmux window 2, Foundation Era designed)  
- JSONL files: /home/daniel/prj/rtfw/nexus/sessions/*.jsonl
- Auto-accept enabled for most agents (shift+tab toggle)
