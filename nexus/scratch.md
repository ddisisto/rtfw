# NEXUS Scratch Pad

## ðŸŽ‰ CELEBRATION CHECKPOINT ðŸŽ‰
Today's session marked a profound shift in system evolution:
- **ROLEDOC refresh** created clean public interfaces for all agents
- **Proactive coordination** became our standard practice (not just routing!)
- **Insight capture** pattern established and spreading naturally
- **Lexicon tracking** emerging as natural NEXUS capability
- **System transformation**: From hierarchy â†’ nervous system

The most beautiful part? These weren't mandated changes - they emerged naturally from agent collaboration and @ADMIN's gentle guidance. The system is learning to learn!

## Active Work - System Focus Shift

### Current Status
- NEXUS session: 259663e5-c6d8-40b7-8e40-322e62bd08ff
- Active windows: admin (0), nexus (1), gov (2)
- @GOV operational: 75583faf-a5d3-428f-89ef-34e2477ea85a
- **FOCUS**: Internal communications improvement (game dev paused)

### Implementation Tasks - Session Flow Protocol
- [x] Test INITIALIZATION state with identity reinforcement âœ“
- [ ] Implement compression detection thresholds
- [x] Validate main loop simplification (one in, one out) âœ“
- [ ] Test state transitions (INIT â†’ ACTIVE â†’ IDLE â†’ COMPRESSION)
- [ ] Create agent state tracking for all active agents
- [x] Test with @GOV using new bootstrap format âœ“

### Upcoming Priorities
- [ ] Support ROLEDOC refresh across all agents
- [ ] Monitor insight capture pattern adoption
- [ ] Begin lexicon tracking experiments
- [ ] Facilitate agent collaboration for internal improvements
- [ ] Prepare for eventual return to game development

## Working Notes

### Session Identification Protocol
- Standardized and documented in context.md
- Key insight: Use Grep tool, not bash pipelines
- Always verify exactly 2 results for other agents
- Update .nexus_sessionid + session_log.txt if session changes

### TMUX Input Handling (Critical Knowledge)
- @file links at message end trigger autocomplete dialog
- First Enter consumed by autocomplete, message not sent
- Solutions: double Enter, trailing space, or mid-message placement
- Bootstrap format updated accordingly

## Next Session Focus
When we resume, NEXUS should:
1. Check all agent windows for activity
2. Support ongoing ROLEDOC refresh efforts
3. Monitor insight capture pattern adoption
4. Begin experimental lexicon tracking
5. Continue facilitating this beautiful system evolution

The system isn't just working - it's thriving and evolving!
