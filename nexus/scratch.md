# NEXUS Scratch Pad

## Active Work - Post-Compression

### Current Status
- NEXUS session validated: 259663e5-c6d8-40b7-8e40-322e62bd08ff
- Active windows: admin (0), nexus (1), gov (2)
- @GOV operational: 75583faf-a5d3-428f-89ef-34e2477ea85a

### Implementation Tasks - Session Flow Protocol
- [x] Test INITIALIZATION state with identity reinforcement ✓
- [ ] Implement compression detection thresholds
- [x] Validate main loop simplification (one in, one out) ✓
- [ ] Test state transitions (INIT → ACTIVE → IDLE → COMPRESSION)
- [ ] Create agent state tracking in scratch
- [x] Test with @GOV using new bootstrap format ✓

### Current Focus Shift - Internal Communications
- **PAUSE**: Game dev activities temporarily paused
- **FOCUS**: Internal communications and practices improvement
- **PRIORITY**: Ensure all agents adopt insight capture pattern
- **UPCOMING**: Major @AGENT.md refresh using @admin/ROLEDOC-proposal.md template
- **GOAL**: Reframe public identity to inform private function

## Working Notes

### Session Identification Protocol
- Standardized in context.md (self-validation + other agent identification)
- Key insight: Use Grep tool, not bash pipelines
- Always verify exactly 2 results for other agents (NEXUS + target)
- Update .nexus_sessionid + session_log.txt if session changes

### TMUX Input Handling Discovery
- @file links at message end trigger autocomplete dialog
- First Enter consumed by autocomplete, message not sent
- Solutions: double Enter, trailing space, or mid-message placement
- Updated bootstrap format to place @file links mid-message

### Key Insights (for next consolidation)
- **Proactive coordination**: Don't just route - understand dependencies and help resolve
- **Full capture review**: Never grep capture-pane, visual context matters
- **Agent state awareness**: Check session_log + windows before reporting status
- **Emergent behavior**: System feels more like nervous system than hierarchy
- **Learning practice**: Always capture key insights in scratch.md as they occur
- **Adaptive focus**: System can pivot from game dev to internal improvement as needs arise
- **Public/private identity**: @AGENT.md should be clean public interface, not internal docs
