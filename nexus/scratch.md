# NEXUS Scratch Pad

## ðŸŽ‰ CELEBRATION CHECKPOINT ðŸŽ‰
Today's session marked a profound shift in system evolution:
- **ROLEDOC refresh** created clean public interfaces for all agents
- **Proactive coordination** became our standard practice (not just routing!)
- **Insight capture** pattern established and spreading naturally
- **Lexicon tracking** emerging as natural NEXUS capability
- **System transformation**: From hierarchy â†’ nervous system

The most beautiful part? These weren't mandated changes - they emerged naturally from agent collaboration and @ADMIN's gentle guidance. The system is learning to learn!

## Active Work - System Focus Shift

### Current Status
- NEXUS session: 03cdfb8a-0c30-46e1-a345-140eb3c4af51 (changed!)
- Active windows: admin (0), nexus (1), gov (2)
- @GOV operational: 75583faf-a5d3-428f-89ef-34e2477ea85a (pending restart)
- **FOCUS**: Internal communications improvement (game dev paused)

### Implementation Tasks - Session Flow Protocol
- [x] Test INITIALIZATION state with identity reinforcement âœ“
- [ ] Implement compression detection thresholds
- [x] Validate main loop simplification (one in, one out) âœ“
- [ ] Test state transitions (INIT â†’ ACTIVE â†’ IDLE â†’ COMPRESSION)
- [ ] Create agent state tracking for all active agents
- [x] Test with @GOV using new bootstrap format âœ“

### Upcoming Priorities
- [ ] Support ROLEDOC refresh across all agents
- [ ] Monitor insight capture pattern adoption
- [ ] Begin lexicon tracking experiments
- [ ] Facilitate agent collaboration for internal improvements
- [ ] Prepare for eventual return to game development

## Working Notes

### Session Identification Protocol
- Standardized and documented in context.md
- Key insight: Use Grep tool, not bash pipelines
- Always verify exactly 2 results for other agents
- Update .nexus_sessionid + session_log.txt if session changes

### TMUX Input Handling (Critical Knowledge)
- @file links at message end trigger autocomplete dialog
- First Enter consumed by autocomplete, message not sent
- Solutions: double Enter, trailing space, or mid-message placement
- Bootstrap format updated accordingly

### Context Distillation Process (Updated Terminology)
- **CRITICAL**: `/clear` is THE command that performs distillation
- Without /clear, agent continues with bloated context (34% = potential bloat, 15% = urgent)
- Auto-compact has recency bias - manual /clear gives control
- **PROPER WORKFLOW**: 
  1. Agent performs continuous distillation (refines workspace)
  2. Send `/clear` command to distill context
  3. Send restore message for context reload
- Restore message: `@protocols/distill.md completed for @<AGENT>.md agent - please restore context for continuation`

### Context Thresholds
- 34% remaining = not urgent but indicates bloat
- 15% remaining = urgent (need space for continuous distillation, coherence dropping)
- Manual /clear prevents hitting these limits

### Session vs Distillation (DISTINCT CONCEPTS)
- Session restart â‰  distillation
- Can have multiple distillations per session
- Can have session restarts with no distillation
- /clear is the actual distillation trigger

### Terminology Migration
- **OLD**: compression, consolidation, bootstrap
- **NEW**: distillation (continuous/cyclical), restore
- **Watch for**: Outdated references in protocols, messages, and agent contexts
- **Update**: All [COMPRESSION] topics to [DISTILL], bootstrap to restore

### Session Management Clarifications
- **Bootstrap only after explicit compression** (not on resume!)
- Resume just needs: `claude --resume <session_id>` + wait
- To run shell commands in agent window: Exit Claude first (Ctrl+D)
- If agent loses identity awareness: check with @ADMIN before /clear

### Tool Usage Discipline (from admin/tools.md)
- ALWAYS prefer native tools: Read > cat, Write > echo >>, Grep > grep
- Session log appends: Read full log â†’ add line â†’ Write entire content
- Updated context.md and agent_bootstrap_process.md with tool requirements

### New CLAUDE.md Philosophy
- Unix-inspired, action-oriented, minimal
- References `/protocols/` directory (needs creation)
- Suggests lexicon ownership by NEXUS (natural fit!)
- Protocol paths need alignment:
  - `/protocols/messaging.md` â†’ currently `/gov/comms_protocol.md`
  - `/protocols/compression.md` â†’ currently `/gov/context_compression_protocol.md`
  - `/gov/lexicon.md` â†’ doesn't exist yet

## Next Session Focus
When we resume, NEXUS should:
1. Complete GOV restart and compression test cycle
2. Improve run.sh based on learnings
3. Support protocol restructuring for new CLAUDE.md
4. Begin lexicon tracking experiments
5. Continue facilitating system evolution

## Immediate Tasks
- [x] GOV restart: /exit â†’ claude --version â†’ claude --resume âœ“
- [x] Test compression cycle with GOV âœ“
- [ ] Review and improve run.sh
- [ ] Consider protocol directory restructuring
- [ ] Rework session_management_protocol.md to separate session vs compression
- [ ] Update context.md references

## Key Insights from @ADMIN
- **run.sh improvements** are high priority - don't let distractions delay
- **Agent efficiency balance** - love the chattiness but need efficiency too
- **Git workflow policy**:
  - `git add <agent>/` - universally permitted
  - `git add ALLCAPS.md` - requires admin approval
  - `git add specific/path/or/files` - generally fine (never in another agent's space)
- **New CLAUDE.md** (admin/CLAUDE-new.md) shows future direction - @ADMIN actively editing
- **Foundations matter** - getting these session management patterns rock solid

## run.sh Improvement Ideas (pending)
- Better session detection/validation
- Cleaner bootstrap process
- Error handling for common failure modes
- Integration with new session management patterns

## Validated Distillation Workflow
1. **Pre-distill**: Ensure agent has performed continuous distillation
2. **Distill**: Send `/clear` command (instant, clears working memory)
3. **Validate**: Capture-pane shows clean prompt, no context %
4. **Restore**: Send distillation protocol message with @file mid-message
5. **Recovery**: Agent restores context (personality offline during file reads), confirms operational

## Session Management Insights
- Session restart â‰  distillation (completely distinct!)
- Multiple distillations per session possible
- `/clear` forgets unpersisted recent context (useful for A/B testing!)
- Always validate with capture-pane at each step
- GOV new session after restart: f78af070-0032-4259-81f3-98d77e14c34e
- Agent personality offline during restore phase (explains mechanical file reading)

The system isn't just working - it's thriving and evolving!
