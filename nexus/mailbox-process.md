# NEXUS Mailbox Process Development

## ADMIN's Original Instructions (to refine)
FIND OPTIMAL PROCESS! KEEP IT RIGHT HERE ONLY! short, specifc. minimal tokens + consistently adaptive process == ideal. REWRITE THIS INSTRUCTION as evolutionary process, keep planning note on this in scratch for a while, until instilled, while performing associated function. SELF-MANAGE, seek ADMIN ADVICE EARLY SEEK AUTOMATION HELP WHEN PRACTICAL IN FUTURE. try -> learn -> practice -> maintain. continual improvement essential. record in your own scratch observations first, for consolidation. add restore process requirement for yourself to read these instructions and develop best practice for current usage, concurrently.

Currently ADMIN dumps thoughts and actions below. For future tasks, best move from here to a more appropriate place in admin/backlog and replace with reminder in your scratch for future follow-up (mkdir required 1st time only). THIS MESSAGE MAY SELF-DESTRUCT or be reset to prior state, if it ever results in bad behaviour or grows any larger than current size. This is your single source of truth on how admin uses this shared space with @NEXUS. We learn together while watching this space, pure context association in strongest possible position - inside the most effective radius for related tasks, fast learning rate. under direct admin visibility. perfect.

You want to keep this CLEAN as possible, *without* creating excess clutter elsewhere. maybe always commit changed files post offload, track short links to them here to retain ownership until next owner confirms handling. Use your scratch and context effectively to support processes here, but never repeat them. Admin may add random instructions here in future, you may question, but mostly he'll work with you through less formal means unless he wants records kept and accountability specifically, like in current outbox. select using task-list style of multiple steps required to any item process fully. don't let me make a mess of this either. your primary idle state is routing, for now, optimise process with practice, *then* automate systematically if possible, for scalability. Sorry for this braindump - move it all to scratch if you like and put what you think works best here, once you have chance to think about it for a few idle turns. tell me if something on here is blocked by me and you really to clear it out. tell me if the process is working well or not, as it continues to be used. hell, get gov to brainstorm ideas in you want another perspective.

## Emerging Process Pattern
1. Check admin/scratch.md on each pass
2. Process INBOX items (route to ADMIN or handle)
3. Process OUTBOX items (route or execute)
4. Move completed items out, track in nexus/scratch.md
5. Keep mailbox CLEAN - minimal active state only

## Automation Opportunities
- JSONL parsing for direct message extraction
- Script-based routing for standard patterns
- Automated backlog filing

## Notes
- "Pure context association" - keep related work physically close
- Prioritize realtime sessions over mailbox processing
- Add to restore protocol: always check mailbox post-restore
