# NEXUS Agent Context

## Current Knowledge Base
- NEXUS functions as the central connection point for all agent communication
- Multi-agent collaboration requires unified messaging standards
- @ADMIN is the system administrator (formerly @PLAYER/@USER/@DEV)
- NEXUS operates as window 0 in single tmux session managing all agents
- Each agent runs in dedicated tmux window with Claude Code session
- JSONL session files provide more accurate monitoring than capture-pane

## TMUX Architecture - VALIDATED
- Single tmux session with multiple windows (not separate sessions)
- NEXUS window 0 manages all other agent windows
- Each agent window runs `claude --resume <SESSION_ID>`
- Terminal bell notifications indicate agent activity completion
- Monitor-content and monitor-silence options track agent status

### Proven TMUX Operations (Tested)
- `tmux new-window -n <name>` - Create named agent windows
- `tmux send-keys -t <window> '<command>' Enter` - Execute commands in agent windows
- `tmux capture-pane -t <window> -p` - Capture agent output for monitoring
- `tmux list-windows` - Monitor all agent window status
- `tmux rename-window <name>` - Rename windows for organization

## Communication Protocols
- All messages must follow format: `@FROM â†’ @TO: [concise message]`
- Messages routed via tmux send-keys between windows
- NEXUS monitors agent outputs for message patterns
- Policy enforcement before action execution
- @GOV consulted for complex decisions

## Session Management Protocol

### Session Log as Single Source of Truth
- nexus/session_log.txt contains append-only session history
- Latest entry per agent is current session ID
- Use nexus/sessions/ symlink for all JSONL file access
- NEVER use hardcoded session IDs in any processes

### Session Resume Process (NEXUS-managed) - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
1. Create agent window: `tmux new-window -n <agent_name>`
2. Read current session ID from session_log.txt (last entry for agent)
3. Monitor existing session files (LS tool on nexus/sessions/) to establish baseline
4. Send tmux command to resume: `tmux send-keys -t <agent_name> 'claude --resume <session_id>' Enter`
5. Monitor for new .jsonl file creation in nexus/sessions/
6. Once new file detected, send validation prompt: `tmux send-keys -t <agent_name> 'Agent ID Check: Please respond with @<AGENT> IDENTITY CONFIRMED' Enter`
7. Monitor new session file for both prompt and expected response using Read tool
8. Upon successful validation, append new session to session_log.txt
9. Git commit session log changes with descriptive message
10. Log session transition in scratch.md

### Data Loss Prevention
- Never attempt session identification via pattern matching
- Only one session resume at a time until new ID confirmed
- Registry updates only after identity validation
- Backup registry state before any updates
- All session operations go through NEXUS validation

### Current Active Sessions
- @NEXUS: 2fc7114d (current, 370K)
- @CODE: 6c859161 (269K active)  
- @GOV: 66a678dc (1.1M active)
- @ARCHITECT: 932ef584 (217K active)
- @RESEARCH: b607ed31 (202K active)
- @HISTORIAN: c7461411 (131B minimal)
- @TEST: bae725c1 (145B minimal)

## Current Tasks
- Implement JSONL-based monitoring system
- Create selective message filtering to avoid context explosion
- Combine JSONL monitoring with tmux silence detection
- Establish approval workflows for agent actions

## Communication Log
- Initial communication protocol established
- Session management investigation in progress

## Development History
- Agent renamed from FACILITATOR to NEXUS
- Tmux-based architecture designed with @ADMIN guidance
- Session management scripts created
- Registry and monitoring systems implemented
- JSONL monitoring approach identified as superior to capture-pane

## Note on Scratch Pad
This agent maintains a separate scratch.md file for working memory, experiments, and temporary notes. See that file for more active work.
