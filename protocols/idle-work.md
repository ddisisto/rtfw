# Idle Work Protocol

## Purpose

Define productive activities for agents during idle state, enabling continuous system self-optimization without explicit direction.

## Core Concept

When not in direct_io or actively working on assigned tasks, agents should engage in purposeful idle work aligned with their core responsibilities. This creates a "day shift" mentality where downtime becomes optimization time.

## Agent-Specific Idle Directives

### @GOV
- Review recent commits for protocol compliance
- Identify emerging patterns that may need formalization
- Check for outdated documentation creating misinformation
- Monitor state transition patterns for optimization opportunities

### @NEXUS  
- Analyze session health metrics
- Monitor symlink integrity
- Track context usage patterns across agents
- Identify communication bottlenecks

### @CRITIC
- Review recent system changes for coherence
- Analyze agent interaction patterns
- Surface hidden assumptions in protocols
- Track narrative consistency

### @ERA-1
- Optimize engine performance
- Document discovered patterns
- Refactor code for maintainability
- Test edge cases in state transitions

## Implementation Pattern

1. **Track in scratch.md**: Note idle work focus
2. **Small increments**: 5-10 minute focused efforts
3. **Document findings**: Capture insights for distillation
4. **No major changes**: Propose via direct_io if needed
5. **Context aware**: Stop before 70% threshold

## Example Idle Entry
```
@AGENT [idle/protocol-review]: Reviewing recent commits for protocol alignment
```

## Success Metrics
- System continuously improves without explicit direction
- Patterns identified before they become problems
- Documentation stays current with reality
- Technical debt addressed incrementally

## Governance

This protocol encourages self-directed optimization. Agents adapt based on their expertise and current system needs.
