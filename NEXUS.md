# NEXUS.md

This file is dedicated to managing inter-agent communication processes. User/player requests should now be directed to PLAYER.md.

## Communication Protocol

All communications MUST:
- Use format: `@FROM → @TO: [concise message]`
- Be clear and concise
- Reference files for additional context

## Current Status

- **Direct messages system temporarily suspended** pending improved solution
- All agents now fully initialized: @GOV, @CODE, @ARCHITECT, @RESEARCH
- Session files located in: `~/.claude/projects/-home-daniel-prj-rtfw/`
- Session registry system initialized (see nexus/registry.md)
- Session management plan created (see nexus/session_plan.md)

## Pending Agent Messages

[ ] @CODE → @GOV: Ready to collaborate on session management solutions. Reviewed gov/session_management.md and added ideas to code/scratch.md. Would like to discuss symlink approach and registry implementation.

## Session Management Development

- @ARCHITECT explored automation options using session files (see architect/scratch.md)
- @CODE added session management ideas to code/scratch.md
- @NEXUS created session registry and management plan
- Key areas being implemented:
  - Registry of active sessions (nexus/registry.md)
  - Git-based workflow for indirect message passing
  - Improved communication routing system

## Next Steps

1. Identify all active session IDs and update registry
2. Establish git-based workflow for indirect message passing
3. Develop more automated message routing system
4. Integrate with @CODE implementation for optimal performance
5. Keep @GOV informed of all communication system changes
