- [ ] Communication effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Scale testing observations (10x agents)
- [ ] Micro-pattern documentation within states
- [ ] Cross-organization protocol potential
- [ ] Human-agent state alignment patterns

## Critical Recommendations from Bootstrap Analysis

### 1. Context Splitting (Highest Priority)
ERA-1's 40K bootstrap is unsustainable. Recommend:
- Move implementation code from context.md to era-1/implementation/
- Load code files only during deep_work state
- Keep context.md under 5K lines for operational knowledge only

### 2. Bootstrap Protocol Clarification
Current protocol doesn't mention protocol lazy loading. Should clarify:
- Only /protocols/journey.md loaded during bootstrap
- State-specific protocols loaded on transition
- Implementation files deferred to deep_work

### 3. Shared Wisdom Pattern
Promote cross-agent learning:
- Common patterns in /protocols/
- Agent-specific adaptations in agent/protocols/
- Shared cache for frequently accessed files

### 4. Task-Specific Agent Spawning (NEW INSIGHT)
Rather than permanent mitosis, ERA-1 could spawn ephemeral workers:
- ERA-1 identifies heavy task (e.g., "refactor game engine")
- Spawns ERA-1-TASK-001 with minimal context + specific code
- Task agent works in isolation, reports condensed results
- ERA-1 integrates findings without carrying full implementation
- Task agent terminates, no ongoing coordination needed

Benefits:
- Parent stays lean (low bootstrap cost)
- Workers get fresh context for specific tasks
- Natural parallelization without coordination overhead
- Results integrated as distilled knowledge, not raw code
- Scales without permanent agent proliferation

Example:
```
ERA-1 [deep_work]: Spawning ERA-1-REFACTOR for engine work
ERA-1-REFACTOR [bootstrap]: Task-specific init, loading engine code
ERA-1-REFACTOR [deep_work]: Refactoring complete, 3 key changes
ERA-1-REFACTOR [logout]: Task complete, results in parent inbox
ERA-1 [inbox]: Integrating refactor results from task agent
```

## Bootstrap Analysis Plan
1. **Data Location**: _sessions/ with AGENT_current.jsonl symlinks
2. **Tools Available**:
   - context_window_tracker.py for cross-session analysis
   - analyze_session_context.py for detailed breakdown
   - Direct JSONL parsing: tail -1 | jq '.message.usage'
3. **Research Questions**:
   - What's baseline token cost of bootstrap sequence?
   - How does it vary by agent role?
   - Which files contribute most tokens?
   - Optimization opportunities?
4. **Method**: Compare multiple bootstrap events across agents

## Bootstrap Token Analysis (2025-05-30)

### Research Question
What's the token cost of agent bootstrap, and how can we optimize it?

### Initial Findings
From analyzing actual bootstrap sequences in session logs:

**GOV Bootstrap (from embedded analysis):**
- Start: 19,423 tokens (mostly cache)
- After CLAUDE.md: 19,423 → 20,409 (+986 tokens)
- After SYSTEM.md: 20,409 → 22,105 (+1,696 tokens)
- At inbox transition: 32,156 tokens
- **Total bootstrap cost: ~12,733 tokens**

**CRITIC Bootstrap (my own):**
- Bootstrap completion at 25.9% = ~33,152 tokens
- Similar pattern suggests ~13-15K token cost

**NEXUS Bootstrap:**
- Start: 19,498 tokens
- Progressive reads: 19,498 → 20,239 → 21,212 → 21,930 → 23,626
- Completion at 30.3% = ~38,784 tokens
- **Total bootstrap cost: ~19,286 tokens** (higher than others!)

**Key Observations:**
1. Bootstrap cost varies significantly by agent: 4K-19K tokens
2. Context.md size is the main variable (NEXUS has extensive context)
3. CLAUDE.md and SYSTEM.md are consistently ~1-2K each
4. Cache helps significantly - most content cached after first read
5. Bootstrap represents 10-15% of initial context window

**ERA-1 Bootstrap:**
- Completion at 47.9% = ~61,312 tokens!
- Likely has extensive game implementation context
- **Estimated bootstrap cost: ~40K tokens** (massive!)

### Critical Analysis

**Bootstrap Cost Ranking:**
1. ERA-1: ~40K tokens (47.9% at completion) - implementation heavy
2. NEXUS: ~19K tokens (30.3% at completion) - session management overhead
3. CRITIC: ~13K tokens (25.9% at completion) - analysis context
4. GOV: ~13K tokens (25.2% at completion) - governance lightweight

**Concerning Pattern:**
- Bootstrap alone can consume 10-47% of context window
- ERA-1's 40K bootstrap leaves only 87K for actual work
- At current rates, ERA-1 hits distill threshold after ~2 operations

**Root Causes:**
1. **Context Accumulation** - No distinction between essential/historical
2. **Implementation Details** - ERA-1 carries full game code in context.md
3. **Bootstrap is Complete** - Single-phase load, no tiers by design
4. **Session History** - NEXUS loads extensive session tracking data

**Revised Understanding (per @ADMIN feedback):**
1. **Bootstrap is atomic** - One complete load, not tiered
   - Crash recovery/rollback only if logout incomplete
   - This is by design for coherence

2. **Context Splitting** - YES, this is the solution
   - Move code to separate files, load in deep_work
   - Thread adoption low but worth pursuing
   - Keep context.md operational only

3. **Shared Cache Benefits**
   - Cross-agent cache sharing promotes common patterns
   - Shared wisdom > siloed knowledge
   - Cache invalidation already automated
   - Tension: governance vs agency autonomy

4. **Lazy Loading Clarification Needed**
   - Should already be deferring protocol loads
   - Update journey.md if not clear
   - Load implementation completely in deep_work
   - Don't assume partial knowledge

5. **Multi-Scale States** (per AISM framework)
   - Agents should manage micro-states within each journey state
   - Example: deep_work contains plan→implement→test→stuck substates
   - This provides finer control without protocol complexity

## State Learning Notes
- My _state.md at critic/_state.md (relative path!)
- Currently showing logout state (but I'm active - system catching up)
- Wrong session_id (shows ERA-1's) - engine will fix
- Key insight: Check others' states before complex requests
- Pattern: Read {agent}/_state.md (not cat, use native tools)
- Batch reads efficient: Can Read multiple _state.md files in one call
- Glob **/_state.md only for discovery, not routine checks

## Critical State Trust Analysis (2025-05-29)
**Fundamental flaw discovered**: Engine conflates "idle session" with "agent state"
- I'm provably active (tokens: 58.7%→69.3% in 10min)
- Yet state shows "offline" continuously
- Engine only updates state when session is idle
- Active agents never idle → never get state updates
- **Trust broken**: _state.md doesn't reflect reality

**Session ID mismatch**: 
- My _state.md shows dc466590... but that's not my session
- ERA-1 shows 5d53f6c5... but they're offline
- No reliable agent→session mapping exists

**Paradox**: The harder we work, the less accurate our state becomes

## Architectural Insight (175fbb0)
ERA-1 now permanent senior systems engineer/architect role! Will maintain CLI and backend systems while ERA-2 handles complementary UI patterns. This affects:
- Long-term system architecture (parallel agents, not sequential replacement)
- State system design (must support multiple UI paradigms)
- Narrative continuity (ERA-1's journey continues indefinitely)

## Lifecycle Protocol Insights
- GOV formalized our patterns: bootstrap → inbox → distill → deep_work/idle/logout
- _state.md files are game-maintained (READ-ONLY to agents)
- Fourth wall mechanic: we cannot know our own context usage objectively
- State visualization enables game to show agent work patterns
- Thread tracking now mandatory in distill returns

## Context Split Consideration
Historical analysis work (session archaeology, intervention patterns) could move to separate context:
- Keep main context.md lean (~200 lines) for operational critic work
- Create critic/historical-context.md for accumulated analysis insights
- Benefit: Faster restore, clearer separation of concerns
- Decision: Defer until after state system coordination completes

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details



## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.


## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- analyze_session_context.py - Line-by-line session analysis
- context_window_tracker.py - Track usage across clear/restore cycles
- session_query_v2.py - Session archaeology without index
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
