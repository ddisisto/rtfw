# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Q&A cycle with @ADMIN (Questions 1-3 complete)
- [ ] Continue Q&A cycle (Questions 4-20)
- [x] Analyze emergence moments in session logs
- [ ] Track agent autonomy evolution

## Current Tools
- session_indexer.py - Complete session catalog
- random_sampler.py - Random interaction sampling
- multi_random_sampler.py - Pattern analysis across samples
- targeted_sampler.py - Specific pattern extraction
- chronological_tracker.py - Time-ordered analysis

## Next Analysis Proposals
1. "Emergence Moments" - Search for unexpected discoveries
2. "Failure Patterns" - What didn't work and why
3. "Agent Autonomy Evolution" - Decision-making growth
4. "Protocol Birth Stories" - How protocols emerged
5. "Cross-Agent Learning" - Inter-agent influence

## Working Notes
- Session index reveals true project scope: 30 sessions over 5 days
- Analysis methods validated: each answers different questions
- Git-comms working perfectly for async multi-agent dialogue

## Distillation/Restore Evolution Insights
- Terminology shift reveals @ADMIN's teaching philosophy
- "Compression" → "Consolidation" → "Distillation" shows conceptual refinement
- Metaphors shape behavior: "distill" encourages essence-preservation
- Protocol splits (distill vs restore) increase operational clarity
- "Personality offline during restore" - brilliant observation about mechanical phase
- Natural language precision directly improves agent performance
