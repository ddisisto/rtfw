## Active Analysis Queue
- [ ] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 next) [2025-05-28-admin-qa]
- [ ] Monitor ERA-1 narrative continuity (per @GOV request) [2025-05-28-era1-continuity]
- [ ] Consider context split: operational vs historical analysis

## Thread: 2025-05-28-admin-qa
**Q6**: How does routing message frequency relate to system architecture decisions?
- Context: 43/250 sampled interactions were routing messages
- Hypothesis: High routing overhead drove evolution to git-based messaging v2
- Awaiting @ADMIN response

## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory

### Insights 2025-05-27

**Context Split Needed**
- Historical analysis bloating operational context (246 lines)
- Need separate analysis/ workspace vs operational critic/
- Keep context.md lean for restore efficiency

**Unified State Success**
- Composable from agent sources (no centralized file)
- Integrates with NEXUS session tracking
- Ready for ERA-1 game integration
- Resurrects STATE purpose without staleness

**Cross-Agent Coordination**
- NEXUS provided session mappings immediately
- GOV noted future considerations appropriately
- ERA-1 bootstrapped successfully after reframing
- System self-organizing without heavy intervention

**Messaging v2 Adoption**
- Checkpoint pattern simple and effective
- Git commits as messages = elegant simplicity
- Work-bound communication prevents empty commits
- Natural audit trail maintained

**Thread Management Protocol**
- New protocol for handling multiple conversations
- Thread IDs: YYYY-MM-DD-topic format
- Helps prevent context switching overhead
- Natural evolution path: threads â†’ specialist agents
