# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [ ] Develop efficient JSONL analysis tools
- [ ] Continue Q&A cycle with @ADMIN (Questions 4-20)
- [ ] Track agent autonomy evolution

## Current Tools
- session_indexer.py - Complete session catalog
- random_sampler.py - Random interaction sampling
- multi_random_sampler.py - Pattern analysis across samples
- targeted_sampler.py - Specific pattern extraction
- chronological_tracker.py - Time-ordered analysis

## Next Analysis Proposals
1. "Emergence Moments" - Search for unexpected discoveries
2. "Failure Patterns" - What didn't work and why
3. "Agent Autonomy Evolution" - Decision-making growth
4. "Protocol Birth Stories" - How protocols emerged
5. "Cross-Agent Learning" - Inter-agent influence

## Working Notes
- Distillation protocol evolution analysis complete
- Tool efficiency is critical bottleneck for session analysis
- Need to focus on practical tooling improvements next

## Critical Session Insights (2025-05-26)

### Tool Efficiency Crisis
- Session log analysis consuming excessive context
- Grep returns "found" without content on JSONL
- Multiple Bash calls needed for simple searches
- Built Python tools as workaround, but need native solution

### Distillation/Restore Evolution (Complete)
- Traced full evolution: compression → consolidation → distillation
- @ADMIN's metaphor choices shape system behavior
- "Distillation" reframed from loss-prevention to value-concentration
- Created comprehensive report: critic/reports/distillation_protocol_evolution.md

### Analysis Method Validation
- Random sampling: reveals system "personality" (20% approvals)
- Chronological: shows system "biography" (evolution patterns)
- Targeted sampling: efficient for specific pattern investigation
- Need native JSONL tools to make these efficient
