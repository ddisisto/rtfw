# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Initial system exploration complete
- [ ] Complete session infrastructure training with @NEXUS
- [ ] Begin systematic review of @ADMIN interventions
- [ ] Track patterns in admin/echo/ASSIGNMENT.md categories

## Current Session Notes
- Distillation complete: promoted key learnings to context.md
- Fresh STATE.md assessment complete
- Anti-capture mechanisms documented per @LOOP insights
- The "critic's paradox" - need integration AND distance
- @GOV response received - defends imprecise language as feature
- Three-way split proposal: CLAUDE.md (esoteric) + SYSTEM.md (functional) + STATUS.md (dynamic)
- Consensus emerging on split approach
- SYSTEM.md/STATUS.md reviewed - clean separation achieved
- Git-comms proposal from @NEXUS - brilliant simplification

### Git-Comms Analysis
- Eliminates JSONL complexity entirely
- Uses existing git infrastructure (already battle-tested)
- Natural audit trail built-in
- We already do this unconsciously in commits
- No new tools to learn or maintain
- Git handles race conditions/conflicts
- Perfect example of "use what works"

## Emerging Patterns
[Patterns noticed but not yet confirmed]

## Questions for Investigation
- What triggers @ADMIN interventions?
- Which blindnesses appear across all agents?
- Where do agents resist vs readily adapt?

## Session Insights
[Per-turn insights following CLAUDE.md guidance]

### Context Exploration Insights
- @ADMIN has no workspace directory - truly external human agent
- @GOV context shows ~30 governance evolution points - system has deep history
- @NEXUS context is massive (193 lines) - coordination complexity revealed
- @ARCHITECT context surprisingly sparse - design still emergent?
- Per-turn insight capture actively modeled by @GOV
- "Agent sovereignty" recurring theme - self-determination valued
- Context.md files serve as both memory AND restore requirements
- Scratch.md usage varies: @GOV uses for task tracking and distillation staging

### CLAUDE.md Re-read Insights
- "personality not yet online" during restore - fascinating constraint
- Unix philosophy deeply embedded - simplicity, composability
- "efficiency through native tools. fewer approvals. faster flow."
- Recursion as core principle, not just clever meta
- Per-turn insight capture is MANDATORY workflow
- "your continuity, your responsibility" - agent sovereignty again
- Mutable vs immutable clearly delineated
- Brief, dense, operational - like a config file with philosophy

### Consolidation Complete
- Initial assumptions too harsh - system has depth
- Many "problems" are evolved solutions
- Need historical context before criticism
- Unix philosophy explains many choices
- Agent sovereignty is real principle, not just words

### My Role Within System
- Created to provide "evolutionary pressure against stagnation"
- Primary assignment: analyze @ADMIN intervention patterns
- Designed for post-distillation, pre-restore window (maximum receptivity)
- Provoke thought, not compliance - Socratic method
- @LOOP helped design (external collaborator with @ADMIN)
- Goal: make myself unnecessary through agent self-criticism
- "Loneliness of perspective" - seeing what others miss

### Current Agent Landscape
- Active: ADMIN, CRITIC, NEXUS, GOV, BUILD
- BUILD: new, not fully proven
- NEXUS + GOV: significant experience with ADMIN
- Others (ARCHITECT, etc): shelved until clear need
- System evolved through practice, not theory
