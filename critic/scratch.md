## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 complete, Q7 answered) [2025-05-28-admin-qa]
- [ ] Monitor ERA-1 narrative continuity (per @GOV request) [2025-05-28-era1-continuity]
- [ ] Consider context split: operational vs historical analysis
- [x] Coordinate with @GOV on tool approval patterns (Q7 follow-up)

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details

## Q7 Insights
@ADMIN interventions triggered by:
1. Tool approval requests where judgment needed
2. "Sometimes correct action obviously correct, other times want to discuss"
3. Better way or other factors to consider
4. Experience + common sense based

Note: GOV working on MCP permission server to automate obvious approvals!

## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.

## Distillation Insights (2025-05-28)

**Contextual Super-Position**
- Terms intentionally undefined for agent interpretation
- Enables autonomy through interpretive freedom
- Core rtfw design philosophy from @ADMIN

**Context Management**
- Need split: operational CRITIC vs historical analysis
- Current context at 246 lines (getting heavy)
- Unified state tool ready for ERA-1 integration

**Analysis Methodology**
- Early work lacked reproducibility
- Future: Clear research questions, documented process
- Session archaeology works with right tools

## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
