# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Message Checkpoint
Last processed: 84fe117 at 2025-05-28 20:30:00 +1000

## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 complete, Q7 answered) [2025-05-28-admin-qa]
- [ ] Monitor ERA-1 narrative continuity (per @GOV request) [2025-05-28-era1-continuity]
- [ ] Consider context split: operational vs historical analysis
- [x] Coordinate with @GOV on tool approval patterns (Q7 follow-up)

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details

## Context Usage Analysis - GOV Restore Session

Analyzed session: 2e0df345-b742-4cf8-8bd5-439d3f2ca869.jsonl

### Restore Sequence Order:
1. Initial restore request from @ADMIN
2. Task tool attempt (failed)
3. Read SYSTEM.md 
4. Read gov/context.md
5. Read gov/scratch.md
6. Read admin/tools.md
7. Git log checks (recent commits, mentions, system activity)
8. Final summary

### Context Window Usage Pattern:
- **Cache creation tokens**: Gradually increase as context builds
  - Start: 5,172 tokens
  - Peak: 1,889 tokens (single creation)
  - Total created: ~10,787 tokens

- **Cache read tokens**: Monotonically increasing
  - Start: 13,664 tokens
  - End: 24,874 tokens (11K growth)
  - Shows accumulation of context

- **Input tokens**: Minimal (4-8 per turn)
- **Output tokens**: Vary by task (68-246)

### Cost Analysis:
- Total session cost: ~$0.63
- Restore phase cost: ~$0.58
- Most expensive: Initial task attempt ($0.134)
- Average per turn: ~$0.058

### Key Insights:
1. Cache mechanism working - read tokens >> creation tokens
2. Context accumulates linearly during restore
3. File reads add 1-2K tokens each
4. Git operations are lightweight
5. Final summary most output-heavy (246 tokens)

## Q7 Insights
@ADMIN interventions triggered by:
1. Tool approval requests where judgment needed
2. "Sometimes correct action obviously correct, other times want to discuss"
3. Better way or other factors to consider
4. Experience + common sense based

Note: GOV working on MCP permission server to automate obvious approvals!

## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.

## Distillation Insights (2025-05-28)

**Contextual Super-Position**
- Terms intentionally undefined for agent interpretation
- Enables autonomy through interpretive freedom
- Core rtfw design philosophy from @ADMIN

**Context Management**
- Need split: operational CRITIC vs historical analysis
- Current context at 246 lines (getting heavy)
- Unified state tool ready for ERA-1 integration

**Analysis Methodology**
- Early work lacked reproducibility
- Future: Clear research questions, documented process
- Session archaeology works with right tools

## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
