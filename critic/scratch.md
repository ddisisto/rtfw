# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [ ] Re-analyze interventions with clear research question (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 next)
- [ ] Review all STATE.md/STATUS.md references for cleanup

## Current Tools
- session_query.py - Unified JSONL query engine
- sessions_index.csv - Agent mappings and timestamps

## Working Notes

## Distillation Insights (2025-05-26 Session)

### Session Navigation Breakthrough
- Traced Q5 (approval pattern) through multiple mentions
- Discovered we never actually answered it despite thinking we had
- Validated new tools by finding exact conversation points efficiently
- Meta-insight: Our analysis of analysis reveals gaps between memory and reality

### Tool Evolution Validated
- Watched ourselves struggle with old tools in historical session
- Experienced smooth operation with new session_query.py
- Proof point: Finding "Understanding your teaching philosophy" instantly vs multiple failed attempts
- Context consumption: ~90% reduction with proper tools

### STATE.md Final Evolution
- STATE.md → CLAUDE/SYSTEM/STATUS split → CLAUDE/SYSTEM only
- STATUS.md failed due to lack of ownership
- Distributed state (agent scratch/context) succeeds due to clear ownership
- Pattern: Ownership > Process for maintaining truth

## Critical Session Insights (2025-05-26)

### Session Analysis Meta-Learning
- **Start with infrastructure basics**: Should have built session index first
- **Duplicate sessions waste ~30% effort**: Resume creates full copies
- **Session-agent mapping essential**: Can't query efficiently without it
- **Tool proliferation anti-pattern**: 10 tools → 1 unified tool
- **Native > Shell always**: Stream processing beats loading

## Archive Review Insights (2025-01-27)

### Methodology Evolution Observed
- Early work: Systematic extraction (batch-001 at 49K) with high rigor
- Middle work: More interpretive, less reproducible
- Recent work: Tool consolidation brings back systematic capability
- Pattern: We oscillate between data extraction and meaning-making

### Value Distribution
- 70% of analyses were one-time explorations (archived)
- 20% contained lasting insights (kept active)
- 10% need rigorous re-work with better tools (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Key finding: Most value came from earliest, most systematic work

### Critical Reflections
- Lack of reproducibility in most analyses justified @ADMIN skepticism
- Tool proliferation (10→1) showed analysis of problem > solving problem
- Best insights came from systematic extraction + human interpretation
- Need balance: automated extraction + thoughtful analysis

### Workspace Cleanup Success
- Clear separation: active work vs historical archive
- Established criteria for future archival decisions
- Created framework for ongoing analysis
- Reduced cognitive load, increased focus

### New Organization Structure (2025-01-27)
- ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW.md - Clear process for new analyses
- ANALYSIS_STATUS.md - Track what's active/complete
- analysis/TEMPLATE.md - Ensure consistency
- analysis/outputs/ - Raw data preservation
- Archive triggers defined (3 months, fully extracted, etc)

### Distillation Integration Note
During distillation:
1. Check ANALYSIS_STATUS.md for completed analyses
2. Move INTEGRATED items to context.md
3. Archive old IN_PROGRESS that stalled
4. Update status tracker

## Distillation Insights (2025-01-27)

### Critical Learning: Analysis Anti-Patterns
- **Over-tooling** - Built 10 tools to avoid using 1 well
- **Over-analysis** - Endless categorization without action
- **Under-methodology** - Exploration without reproducibility
- **Assumption accumulation** - Never questioned our categories

### Intervention Analysis True Goal
Not just counting @ADMIN messages, but understanding:
1. **Quality standards** - What triggers correction?
2. **System learning** - How do patterns change behavior?
3. **Prevention vs correction** - Proactive vs reactive guidance
4. **Collaboration patterns** - Human-AI working relationship

### Archive Review Meta-Lesson
The act of reviewing our analyses revealed more than the analyses themselves:
- We oscillate between data extraction and meaning-making
- Best work happens at the intersection
- Organization is prerequisite for insight
- Skepticism is diagnostic tool

### Methodology Principles Discovered
1. **Start with clear question** - Not "analyze interventions" but "what are quality triggers?"
2. **Use minimal tooling** - One good tool > ten specialized
3. **Preserve raw data** - Interpretation changes, data doesn't
4. **Track confidence** - Distinguish observation from inference
5. **Seek actionable insights** - "So what?" test for every finding

### Tool Consolidation Success
- Replaced 10 specialized tools with session_query.py
- Strict indexing requirement prevents confusion
- CSV index provides fast agent lookup
- Deduplication revealed true work patterns

### Project Timeline Insights
- **5-day burst development** (May 21-26)
- **Clear phases**: bootstrap → governance → implementation → critique
- **GOV 4-day marathon** shows deep architectural work
- **BUILD replaced CODE** mid-project (domain specialization)
- **Only 3 active agents now**: NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC

### Outdated Context Corrections Needed
- Remove references to inactive agents (CODE, GAMEDESIGN, etc.)
- Update "Active agents" lists everywhere
- Clarify BUILD deprecation wasn't failure but evolution
- Document session deduplication as standard practice
