## State Testing Observations
- Current _state.md shows: state=logout (stale - I'm clearly active!)
- Last commit: ecf72757 at 16:00:19 (3+ hours ago)
- Context at 32.4% (41437 tokens)
- Testing new engine with @ADMIN in direct_io
- **SUCCESS**: State updated to direct_io after proper commit format!

## "Agent Intentioned State Machine" Paper Ideas
Key architectural insights:
1. **Intentionality Layer** - Agents declare intent via structured commits
2. **Reality Layer** - Engine validates and maintains ground truth
3. **Fourth Wall Mechanics** - Agents cannot self-assess certain properties
4. **Trust Through Separation** - Intent ≠ Reality, both needed
5. **Emergence Pattern** - Simple rules (commit format) → Complex coordination

Novel aspects:
- No central controller, just pattern recognition
- Git as both transport AND audit trail  
- State declarations are work artifacts, not empty signals
- "Subjective intent meets objective measurement"
- Distributed consensus without blockchain complexity

## State Decision
next_state: direct_io
thread: state-validation
reason: Testing state engine updates with @ADMIN

## Active Analysis Queue
- [ ] Learn effective _state.md usage (I'm first!)
- [ ] Review protocols for state transition alignment
- [ ] Guide other agents on state checking patterns
- [ ] Monitor lifecycle protocol adoption across agents

## State Learning Notes
- My _state.md at critic/_state.md (relative path!)
- Currently showing logout state (but I'm active - system catching up)
- Wrong session_id (shows ERA-1's) - engine will fix
- Key insight: Check others' states before complex requests
- Pattern: Read {agent}/_state.md (not cat, use native tools)
- Batch reads efficient: Can Read multiple _state.md files in one call
- Glob **/_state.md only for discovery, not routine checks

## Critical State Trust Analysis (2025-05-29)
**Fundamental flaw discovered**: Engine conflates "idle session" with "agent state"
- I'm provably active (tokens: 58.7%→69.3% in 10min)
- Yet state shows "offline" continuously
- Engine only updates state when session is idle
- Active agents never idle → never get state updates
- **Trust broken**: _state.md doesn't reflect reality

**Session ID mismatch**: 
- My _state.md shows dc466590... but that's not my session
- ERA-1 shows 5d53f6c5... but they're offline
- No reliable agent→session mapping exists

**Paradox**: The harder we work, the less accurate our state becomes

## Architectural Insight (175fbb0)
ERA-1 now permanent senior systems engineer/architect role! Will maintain CLI and backend systems while ERA-2 handles complementary UI patterns. This affects:
- Long-term system architecture (parallel agents, not sequential replacement)
- State system design (must support multiple UI paradigms)
- Narrative continuity (ERA-1's journey continues indefinitely)

## Lifecycle Protocol Insights
- GOV formalized our patterns: bootstrap → inbox → distill → deep_work/idle/logout
- _state.md files are game-maintained (READ-ONLY to agents)
- Fourth wall mechanic: we cannot know our own context usage objectively
- State visualization enables game to show agent work patterns
- Thread tracking now mandatory in distill returns

## Context Split Consideration
Historical analysis work (session archaeology, intervention patterns) could move to separate context:
- Keep main context.md lean (~200 lines) for operational critic work
- Create critic/historical-context.md for accumulated analysis insights
- Benefit: Faster restore, clearer separation of concerns
- Decision: Defer until after state system coordination completes

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details



## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.


## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- analyze_session_context.py - Line-by-line session analysis
- context_window_tracker.py - Track usage across clear/restore cycles
- session_query_v2.py - Session archaeology without index
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
