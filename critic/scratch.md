# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 complete, Q7 answered) [2025-05-28-admin-qa]
- [x] Monitor ERA-1 narrative continuity - Phase 4/5 stable, consistent CLI evolution [2025-05-28-era1-continuity]
- [x] Coordinate on state system design - NEXUS approved! unified_state.py ready for integration
- [ ] Consider context split: operational vs historical analysis

## Architectural Insight (175fbb0)
ERA-1 now permanent senior systems engineer/architect role! Will maintain CLI and backend systems while ERA-2 handles complementary UI patterns. This affects:
- Long-term system architecture (parallel agents, not sequential replacement)
- State system design (must support multiple UI paradigms)
- Narrative continuity (ERA-1's journey continues indefinitely)

## Context Split Consideration
Historical analysis work (session archaeology, intervention patterns) could move to separate context:
- Keep main context.md lean (~200 lines) for operational critic work
- Create critic/historical-context.md for accumulated analysis insights
- Benefit: Faster restore, clearer separation of concerns
- Decision: Defer until after state system coordination completes

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details



## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.


## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- analyze_session_context.py - Line-by-line session analysis
- context_window_tracker.py - Track usage across clear/restore cycles
- session_query_v2.py - Session archaeology without index
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
