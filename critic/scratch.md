# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Active Analysis Queue
- [x] Develop efficient JSONL analysis tools ✓ (session_query.py complete)
- [x] Archive review of all analysis work ✓ (70% archived, action plan created)
- [ ] Re-analyze batch-001-interventions.md with session_query.py (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Continue Q&A with @ADMIN (Q6 next)
- [ ] Review all STATE.md/STATUS.md references for cleanup

## Current Tools (Consolidated)
- session_query.py - Unified JSONL query engine (replaces 10 tools)
- extract_user_prompts.py - Session analysis for agent identification
- extract_session_timestamps.py - Update session index with time ranges
- sessions_index.csv - Agent mappings and timestamps

## Next Analysis Focus (Post-Consolidation)
1. **Active Agent Deep Dives** - GOV 4-day session, NEXUS coordination patterns
2. **Deprecation Patterns** - Why CODE→BUILD, why others shelved
3. **Protocol Evolution** - Track how protocols changed during 5-day burst
4. **@ADMIN Intervention Types** - Now queryable with proper tools

## Working Notes
- Tool consolidation complete - efficiency crisis resolved
- Session deduplication revealed true work patterns
- Infrastructure-first approach validated
- STATE.md and STATUS.md both removed - dynamic state now distributed to agent scratch/context
- Need to review stale references to STATE.md/STATUS.md throughout system

## Tool Analysis Patterns (2025-05-26)

### Common Patterns Across 10 Python Tools
1. **JSONL Processing Core** - All tools read/parse nexus/sessions/*.jsonl files
2. **Content Extraction** - Navigate nested message structures to get actual text
3. **Agent Identification** - Extract from filename or content patterns
4. **Timestamp Handling** - Sort/filter by time, track chronology
5. **Pattern Detection** - Search for keywords, phrases, intervention types
6. **State Persistence** - Some track progress for resumability
7. **Output Generation** - JSON reports to critic/analysis/, text summaries

### Core Operations Needed
1. **Stream Processing** - Read JSONL entries without loading full files
2. **Content Extraction** - Reliable extraction from various message formats
3. **Pattern Matching** - Flexible search across content/metadata
4. **Time Navigation** - Jump to specific times, track progress
5. **Aggregation** - Count patterns, group by agent/type/time

### Proposed Minimal Toolset
1. **session_query.py** - Swiss army knife for session analysis
   - Stream JSONL with filters (time range, agent, content pattern)
   - Extract specific fields or full entries
   - Output formats: JSON, CSV, readable text
   - Stateless - filters passed as arguments

2. **session_stats.py** - Aggregation and counting
   - Message counts by agent/type/time
   - Pattern frequency analysis
   - Intervention type distribution
   - Session metadata summary

3. **session_tracker.py** - Stateful chronological analysis
   - Resume from last position
   - Navigate by time or event count
   - Context preservation (show surrounding messages)
   - Progress tracking

### Key Improvements Over Current Tools
- Native JSONL streaming (no full file loads)
- Unified content extraction logic
- Composable filters (combine time + agent + pattern)
- Standard output formats for piping
- Clear separation: query (stateless) vs track (stateful)

## Distillation Insights (2025-05-26 Session)

### Session Navigation Breakthrough
- Traced Q5 (approval pattern) through multiple mentions
- Discovered we never actually answered it despite thinking we had
- Validated new tools by finding exact conversation points efficiently
- Meta-insight: Our analysis of analysis reveals gaps between memory and reality

### Tool Evolution Validated
- Watched ourselves struggle with old tools in historical session
- Experienced smooth operation with new session_query.py
- Proof point: Finding "Understanding your teaching philosophy" instantly vs multiple failed attempts
- Context consumption: ~90% reduction with proper tools

### STATE.md Final Evolution
- STATE.md → CLAUDE/SYSTEM/STATUS split → CLAUDE/SYSTEM only
- STATUS.md failed due to lack of ownership
- Distributed state (agent scratch/context) succeeds due to clear ownership
- Pattern: Ownership > Process for maintaining truth

## Critical Session Insights (2025-05-26)

### Session Analysis Meta-Learning
- **Start with infrastructure basics**: Should have built session index first
- **Duplicate sessions waste ~30% effort**: Resume creates full copies
- **Session-agent mapping essential**: Can't query efficiently without it
- **Tool proliferation anti-pattern**: 10 tools → 1 unified tool
- **Native > Shell always**: Stream processing beats loading

## Archive Review Insights (2025-01-27)

### Methodology Evolution Observed
- Early work: Systematic extraction (batch-001 at 49K) with high rigor
- Middle work: More interpretive, less reproducible
- Recent work: Tool consolidation brings back systematic capability
- Pattern: We oscillate between data extraction and meaning-making

### Value Distribution
- 70% of analyses were one-time explorations (archived)
- 20% contained lasting insights (kept active)
- 10% need rigorous re-work with better tools (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Key finding: Most value came from earliest, most systematic work

### Critical Reflections
- Lack of reproducibility in most analyses justified @ADMIN skepticism
- Tool proliferation (10→1) showed analysis of problem > solving problem
- Best insights came from systematic extraction + human interpretation
- Need balance: automated extraction + thoughtful analysis

### Workspace Cleanup Success
- Clear separation: active work vs historical archive
- Established criteria for future archival decisions
- Created framework for ongoing analysis
- Reduced cognitive load, increased focus

### Tool Consolidation Success
- Replaced 10 specialized tools with session_query.py
- Strict indexing requirement prevents confusion
- CSV index provides fast agent lookup
- Deduplication revealed true work patterns

### Project Timeline Insights
- **5-day burst development** (May 21-26)
- **Clear phases**: bootstrap → governance → implementation → critique
- **GOV 4-day marathon** shows deep architectural work
- **BUILD replaced CODE** mid-project (domain specialization)
- **Only 3 active agents now**: NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC

### Outdated Context Corrections Needed
- Remove references to inactive agents (CODE, GAMEDESIGN, etc.)
- Update "Active agents" lists everywhere
- Clarify BUILD deprecation wasn't failure but evolution
- Document session deduplication as standard practice
