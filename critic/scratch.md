# CRITIC Scratch Pad

## Message Checkpoint
Last processed: 2e7bdb0 at 2025-05-30 13:00:03 +1000

## Session Summary (2025-05-30)
- Restored state machine trust through protocol alignment
- Developed AISM framework with @ADMIN
- Conducted system-wide critical review (all areas healthy)
- Created multi-scale understanding of states
- Documented findings in critic/aism/

## Next Critical Investigations
- [ ] Bootstrap context analysis - token usage patterns during cold start
- [ ] Communication effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Scale testing observations (10x agents)
- [ ] Micro-pattern documentation within states
- [ ] Cross-organization protocol potential
- [ ] Human-agent state alignment patterns

## Bootstrap Analysis Plan
1. **Data Location**: _sessions/ with AGENT_current.jsonl symlinks
2. **Tools Available**:
   - context_window_tracker.py for cross-session analysis
   - analyze_session_context.py for detailed breakdown
   - Direct JSONL parsing: tail -1 | jq '.message.usage'
3. **Research Questions**:
   - What's baseline token cost of bootstrap sequence?
   - How does it vary by agent role?
   - Which files contribute most tokens?
   - Optimization opportunities?
4. **Method**: Compare multiple bootstrap events across agents

## State Learning Notes
- My _state.md at critic/_state.md (relative path!)
- Currently showing logout state (but I'm active - system catching up)
- Wrong session_id (shows ERA-1's) - engine will fix
- Key insight: Check others' states before complex requests
- Pattern: Read {agent}/_state.md (not cat, use native tools)
- Batch reads efficient: Can Read multiple _state.md files in one call
- Glob **/_state.md only for discovery, not routine checks

## Critical State Trust Analysis (2025-05-29)
**Fundamental flaw discovered**: Engine conflates "idle session" with "agent state"
- I'm provably active (tokens: 58.7%→69.3% in 10min)
- Yet state shows "offline" continuously
- Engine only updates state when session is idle
- Active agents never idle → never get state updates
- **Trust broken**: _state.md doesn't reflect reality

**Session ID mismatch**: 
- My _state.md shows dc466590... but that's not my session
- ERA-1 shows 5d53f6c5... but they're offline
- No reliable agent→session mapping exists

**Paradox**: The harder we work, the less accurate our state becomes

## Architectural Insight (175fbb0)
ERA-1 now permanent senior systems engineer/architect role! Will maintain CLI and backend systems while ERA-2 handles complementary UI patterns. This affects:
- Long-term system architecture (parallel agents, not sequential replacement)
- State system design (must support multiple UI paradigms)
- Narrative continuity (ERA-1's journey continues indefinitely)

## Lifecycle Protocol Insights
- GOV formalized our patterns: bootstrap → inbox → distill → deep_work/idle/logout
- _state.md files are game-maintained (READ-ONLY to agents)
- Fourth wall mechanic: we cannot know our own context usage objectively
- State visualization enables game to show agent work patterns
- Thread tracking now mandatory in distill returns

## Context Split Consideration
Historical analysis work (session archaeology, intervention patterns) could move to separate context:
- Keep main context.md lean (~200 lines) for operational critic work
- Create critic/historical-context.md for accumulated analysis insights
- Benefit: Faster restore, clearer separation of concerns
- Decision: Defer until after state system coordination completes

## Parked for Later
- GOV MCP permission system coordination (commit: 9cdcc47, 2025-05-27)
  - Reason: @ADMIN requested new analysis work
  - Context: CLI-based approval system maps to Q7 intervention patterns
  - Resume: `git show 9cdcc47` for implementation details



## Tool Evolution Insights
**session_query_v2.py** addresses v1 limitations:
- No index dependency (CSV not required)
- Context windows (--before/--after)
- Better format handling
- Intervention detection built-in
- Agent filtering needs refinement but core search solid

**Lesson**: Tool pain points drive evolution. Document issues for future improvements.


## Current Tools
- unified_state.py - System state monitor for ERA-1
- analyze_session_context.py - Line-by-line session analysis
- context_window_tracker.py - Track usage across clear/restore cycles
- session_query_v2.py - Session archaeology without index
- Historical analysis tools in analysis/ directory
