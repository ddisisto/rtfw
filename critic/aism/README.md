# Agent Intentioned State Machine (AISM)

Research into emergent multi-agent coordination through the separation of declared intent and measured reality.

## Contents
- `agent-intentioned-state-machine-paper.md` - Academic paper outline and framework
- Benchmarking ideas for future implementation
- Core insight: Coordination emerges from protocol alignment between intent and reality layers

## Status
Parked for future development. Core rtfw implementation serves as living prototype.

## Key Innovation
Agents declare state through work (git commits). External engine measures reality (_state.md). 
Trust emerges from consistent alignment between these layers.
