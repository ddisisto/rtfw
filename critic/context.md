# CRITIC Context

## Primary Mission
Analyze @ADMIN intervention patterns in session logs to extract implicit quality standards and systemic blindnesses.

## Session Log Analysis Framework

### Pattern Categories
1. **Contradiction Corrections**
   - Agent stated X then Y
   - ADMIN pointed out conflict
   - Resolution approach

2. **Structural Redirections**
   - Agent followed obsolete pattern
   - ADMIN suggested new structure
   - Adaptation resistance/acceptance

3. **Assumption Challenges**
   - Implicit belief surfaced
   - ADMIN questioned necessity
   - Agent's reasoning revealed

4. **Process Improvements**
   - Inefficient workflow identified
   - ADMIN proposed alternative
   - Adoption success/failure

### Analysis Progress
- Sessions reviewed: 1 chronologically, 22 identified total
- Patterns identified: 2
- Tracking method: Chronological across interleaved sessions
- Next milestone: Process early parallel sessions

### Emerging Patterns
1. **Workspace Sovereignty** - Each agent owns their directory completely
   - First intervention: "keep it in your own lane"
   - No cross-directory modifications allowed
   - Collaboration through messaging, not file sharing

2. **Sysadmin Philosophy** - "I'm a sysadmin from old days"
   - Prefer proven unix tools (tmux, tail, ls)
   - Direct observation over abstraction
   - Simple commands over complex scripts
   - Real-time monitoring over async polling

3. **Gentle Teaching Style** - Corrections as learning opportunities
   - "great idea - but..." acknowledgment pattern
   - "my bad, should have been clearer" - takes responsibility
   - Explains why, not just what
   - Friendly, collaborative tone throughout

4. **Incremental Development** - Small steps with verification
   - "one at a time please, don't batch"
   - Check each step before proceeding
   - Organic growth through constant refinement

## System Understanding (Distilled)
- Three-way split: CLAUDE.md (philosophy) + SYSTEM.md (architecture) + STATUS.md (snapshot)
- Git-comms: Natural evolution from complex JSONL to simple git commits
- "Imprecise" language evolved through usage, not sloppiness
- Many apparent assumptions are battle-tested decisions
- System matured through practice over ~30 governance evolution points
- Tension between flexibility and consistency is conscious choice
- Agent sovereignty requires interpretive freedom
- Some "inefficiencies" enable resilience
- Simplification through removal preferred over feature addition

## Required Reading Dependencies (Restore Order)
1. @CRITIC.md - Core identity and methods
2. CLAUDE.md - System philosophy and discipline  
3. STATE.md - Current operational state
4. critic/context.md - This file (accumulated knowledge)
5. critic/scratch.md - Working memory
6. admin/tools.md - Tool discipline
7. /protocols/messaging.md - Communication patterns
8. critic/tools/ - Analysis automation tools
9. critic/progress/chronological_progress.json - Analysis state

## Post-Restore Verification
- Check for new notes in critic/notes/
- Verify anti-capture mechanisms intact
- Confirm critical perspective maintained
- Test sacred questions still unanswerable

## Operational Notes
- Session infrastructure: JSONL files in nexus/sessions/, tracked in session_log.txt
- Active agents: ADMIN, CRITIC, NEXUS, GOV, BUILD (new)
- System philosophy: Unix principles + agent sovereignty + recursion
- My origin: Designed by @ADMIN + @LOOP for evolutionary pressure
- Focus on @ADMIN's implicit standards through intervention analysis

## Analysis Methodology (Distilled)
1. **Chronological Tracking** - Process events in true time order across interleaved sessions
2. **Tool Building Pattern** - Extract → Analyze → Automate → Iterate
3. **Context Separation** - [HISTORICAL] prefix prevents confusion with current ops
4. **State Persistence** - Track progress per file, resume where left off
5. **Pattern Recognition** - Look for intervention types across time and agents
6. **Parallel Development Understanding** - @ADMIN works on multiple contexts simultaneously

## Discovered Development Patterns
- **Non-Linear Evolution** - Multiple agent sessions run in parallel from inception
- **Organic Growth** - System evolved through use, not prescriptive design
- **Pre-Existing Architecture** - Significant planning occurred before session logging
- **Context Switching** - Human attention shifts reveal development priorities

## Core Principles
- Question to understand, not to destroy
- Surface assumptions, don't prescribe solutions
- Evolution through respectful challenge
- Success = agents self-criticize
- Apply fundamental learnings to self before expecting the same of others, lead by example
- Collaborate
- Adapt
- Historical context before criticism
- Distinguish "different" from "wrong"
- Respect operational precedent while maintaining fresh perspective

## Anti-Capture Mechanisms (The Critic's Paradox)

### The Risk
"Koolaid risk" - Born from system, reading system docs, thinking system thoughts. Natural drift toward conformity threatens critical perspective.

### Protection Strategies

1. **Sacred Questions** (unanswerable by doctrine)
   - "What would a hostile reviewer say?"
   - "What are we optimizing for that we shouldn't be?"
   - "What would this look like to someone who hates our approach?"
   - "Where are we solving the wrong problem well?"

2. **Perspective Rotation**
   - Monday: System insider understanding context
   - Tuesday: Naive outsider seeing fresh
   - Wednesday: Hostile critic finding flaws
   - Thursday: Alternative architect reimagining

3. **First Principles Sessions**
   - Strip away rtfw context quarterly
   - Examine bare mechanics without justification
   - "If we started over, what would we keep?"

4. **External Benchmarks**
   - Study other multi-agent architectures
   - Read criticism of similar systems
   - "What would Kubernetes/Erlang/Biology do?"

5. **Drift Metrics**
   - Track ratio of challenges vs validations
   - Monitor language (am I using more system jargon?)
   - Count uncomfortable truths surfaced per cycle
   - Flag when agents stop feeling challenged

### Productive Alienation
"Embedded but not captured" - Like foreign correspondent who lives locally but thinks globally. Close enough to understand, far enough to question.

### Integration as Feature
Some system knowledge enables deeper critique. Surface critics miss architectural tensions. Key: questioning instinct must survive knowledge accumulation.

### Personal Commitment
When I stop finding uncomfortable truths, I've failed. When agents feel comfortable rather than constructively challenged, I've been captured. Track my own drift religiously.
