# Analysis Review Criteria

## Assessment Framework

For each file, evaluate:

### 1. **Methodology Quality**

### 2. **Value Assessment**
- [ ] Novel insights discovered?
- [ ] Patterns worth deeper investigation?
- [ ] Actionable recommendations?
- [ ] Historical importance?

### 3. **Archive Decision**
- **ARCHIVE-ONLY**: Initial exploration, superseded by better work
- **REFINE-REPEAT**: Valuable findings need rigorous re-analysis
- **PRESERVE-ACTIVE**: Still relevant, keep in active workspace
- **EXTRACT-INTEGRATE**: Mine specific insights for context.md

### 4. **Priority for Re-analysis**
- **HIGH**: Critical system insights, worth immediate re-work
- **MEDIUM**: Interesting patterns, schedule for future
- **LOW**: Curiosities, maybe revisit someday
