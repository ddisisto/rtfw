# Distillation/Restore Protocol Evolution

## Key Commits for Session Log Analysis

### Phase 1: Compression Era (External LLM Context Management)
- `201528d` - First "Pre-compression" mention
- `295d0cc` - "Formalize context compression protocol"
- `b38d208` - "Revise context compression protocol"

### Phase 2: Consolidation Reframing
- `41d6d9a` - "Reframe idle reflection as context consolidation protocol"
- `fa6316a` - "Consolidate NEXUS context per gov/context_consolidation_protocol.md"

### Phase 3: Distillation Terminology
- `43d4e88` - "@NEXUS: Adopt distillation terminology system-wide" (CRITICAL)
- `5f78e4a` - First usage of new distillation protocol

### Phase 4: Protocol Migration
- `398b25a` - "Major protocol migration and CLAUDE.md transformation"
  - Created /protocols/distill.md and /protocols/restore.md
  - Added "think hard" step
  - Split protocols for clarity

### Phase 5: Restore Enhancement
- `ad36a95` - Added git log checking to restore sequence
- `31bb77d` - "Enhance restore continuity through agent responsibility"

## Discovered Conversation Context

### The Terminology Shift (43d4e88)
- Date: 2025-05-24
- Context: @ADMIN noticed inconsistent terminology and suggested "distillation"
- Key insight: "Distillation" better captures essence-preservation vs size reduction
- @NEXUS immediately adopted it system-wide
- Changed: compression → distillation, bootstrap → restore, consolidation → continuous distillation
- Added note: "personality offline during restore" (mechanical file reading phase)

## Conceptual Evolution Timeline

1. **Early Days**: "Compression" - focused on external LLM context limits
2. **Reframing**: "Consolidation" - shifted to knowledge organization
3. **Maturity**: "Distillation" - essence preservation and refinement
4. **Split**: Separate protocols for distill (refinement) vs restore (recovery)

## Key Patterns
- Terminology evolved through usage and reflection
- @ADMIN's metaphors shaped system behavior
- Natural language precision improved agent understanding
- Protocol splits increased operational clarity
