# Context Switching Pattern Analysis

## Discovery
The project's session logs reveal a complex pattern of parallel work across multiple agents. Rather than linear development, @ADMIN (the human) was orchestrating multiple contexts simultaneously.

## Early Session Overview (2025-05-21)
- **05:57**: Two sessions start simultaneously (66a678dc and f5a74925)
- **07:44**: Third session begins (6c859161) 
- **08:12**: GAMEDESIGN sessions start (932ef584 and 51f1fab0)
- **09:07**: RESEARCH session begins (b607ed31)
- **13:36**: NEXUS sessions start (2fc7114d and c4088511)

## Pattern Insights
1. **Parallel Development**: Multiple agent sessions running concurrently
2. **Deep Dives**: Some sessions span multiple days (e.g., GAMEDESIGN: 05-21 to 05-22)
3. **Context Juggling**: Human switches between agents based on development needs

## Tracking Strategy
To properly analyze this:
1. Track last processed timestamp per file
2. Process events in true chronological order
3. Note context switches and attempt to infer why
4. Build understanding of how agents emerged and evolved

## Technical Implementation
Created chronological_tracker.py to:
- Maintain progress state across sessions
- Use priority queue for true chronological ordering
- Detect and highlight context switches
- Track which agent each session represents

This interleaved pattern will make the analysis more complex but also more revealing of the organic evolution of the system.
