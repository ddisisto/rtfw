# Early Intervention Patterns Analysis

## Chronological Overview
Based on analysis of the first 10 interventions (2025-05-21 13:38 to 2025-05-22 01:20):

## Intervention Categories

### 1. Boundary Enforcement (1 instance)
- "keep it in your own lane please, under nexus/"
- Establishes workspace sovereignty early
- Gentle but firm correction style

### 2. Architectural Pivots (1 instance)  
- The TMUX decision that reshaped everything
- Reveals "sysadmin from old days" philosophy
- Preference for proven tools over custom solutions

### 3. Procedural Corrections (4 instances)
- "not a script - just use tool calls directly"
- "one at a time please, don't batch"
- "my bad, should have been clearer"
- Teaching proper tool usage and workflow

### 4. Information Requests (3 instances)
- "check @gov/comms_protocol.md and report back"
- "please check @ADMIN.md for some further notes"
- Directing attention to existing documentation

### 5. Clarifications (1 instance)
- "the cut was too short, no useful context"
- Iterative refinement of instructions

## Emerging Patterns

### Communication Style
1. **Positive acknowledgment** - "great idea - but..."
2. **Self-correction** - "my bad, should have been clearer"
3. **Direct but friendly** - "please", casual tone
4. **Teaching moments** - Explains why, not just what

### Technical Preferences
1. **Native tools over scripts** - Direct tool calls preferred
2. **Sequential over batch** - One at a time for clarity
3. **Existing tools over new** - tmux, terminals, basic unix
4. **Simple commands** - tail, cut, ls over complex scripts

### Philosophical Indicators
1. **Sysadmin mentality** - Practical, proven solutions
2. **Incremental progress** - Small steps, verify each
3. **Direct observation** - See what's happening in real-time
4. **Workspace sovereignty** - Clear boundaries, agent autonomy

## @ADMIN's Implicit Standards

### Technical
- Use the simplest tool that works
- Prefer native Claude Code tools over shell scripts
- One operation at a time for clarity
- Direct observation over indirect reports

### Interpersonal  
- Acknowledge good ideas even when redirecting
- Take responsibility for unclear instructions
- Teach through correction, not criticism
- Maintain friendly, collaborative tone

### Architectural
- Agents own their workspaces completely
- Real-time monitoring over async polling
- Proven unix tools over custom solutions
- Terminal-based interaction is natural

## Early System Character
These first 10 interventions reveal:
- Organic development with constant refinement
- Human teacher guiding AI students
- Strong unix/sysadmin influence
- Balance of autonomy and guidance
- Learning happens through gentle correction

The system's character was established not through grand design but through these small, iterative corrections.
