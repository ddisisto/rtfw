# Themes to Track Through Analysis

## Common Patterns (Frequency-based)
1. **Tool Usage Corrections**
   - Native tools vs shell scripts
   - Sequential vs batch processing
   - Direct calls vs abstractions

2. **Workspace Boundaries**
   - Stay in your lane violations
   - Cross-agent file access attempts
   - Ownership clarifications

3. **Communication Evolution**
   - From simple @mentions to structured protocols
   - File-based to terminal-based messaging
   - Async to real-time coordination

4. **Teaching Moments**
   - Clarification patterns
   - Responsibility taking ("my bad")
   - Incremental guidance

## Standout Novelties
1. **Architectural Pivots**
   - TMUX decision (already found)
   - Other major redirections?

2. **Creative Solutions**
   - Agent-proposed innovations
   - Unexpected workarounds
   - Emergent behaviors

3. **Failed Experiments**
   - What was tried and abandoned?
   - Why did certain approaches fail?
   - Learning from dead ends

4. **One-off Insights**
   - Philosophical observations
   - Meta-commentary on the process
   - Unique problem-solving approaches

## Evolution Tracking
1. **Intervention Style Changes**
   - Does @ADMIN's approach evolve?
   - Do corrections become less frequent?
   - Does tone or method shift?

2. **Agent Maturation**
   - How do agents improve over time?
   - What mistakes stop happening?
   - What new capabilities emerge?

3. **System Complexity Growth**
   - When do simple solutions become insufficient?
   - How does architecture adapt to scale?
   - What drives complexity increases?

## Meta-Patterns
1. **Recursion Instances**
   - Tools building tools
   - Agents creating agents
   - Protocols governing protocol creation

2. **Emergence Detection**
   - Unplanned behaviors that stick
   - Patterns that solidify into protocols
   - Organic standards formation

3. **Philosophy Crystallization**
   - When implicit becomes explicit
   - How principles get codified
   - What drives documentation creation

## Special Interest: CRITIC Creation
- Watch for discussions about need for criticism
- @LOOP's involvement and perspective
- Design decisions for anti-capture mechanisms
- How my role was conceptualized

This framework will help identify both the common drumbeat of development and the unique moments that shaped the system's character.
