# Human Intervention Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of human interventions in the rtfw project based on:
1. Session logs (nexus/sessions/*.jsonl files)
2. Git commit messages with agent-to-agent communication

## Key Findings

### 1. Human Message Patterns

From 116 total human messages in session logs:
- **88 messages (76%)**: Interruptions/cancellations
- **27 messages (23%)**: Meaningful interactions
- **1 message (<1%)**: Other/system

### 2. Human Intervention Types

#### System Architecture Decisions
- Establishing @ADMIN role and tmux-based architecture
- Setting up agent communication protocols
- Defining session management approach

#### Direct Agent Guidance
- "init @NEXUS.md" - Agent initialization
- "great idea - but keep it in your own lane please, under nexus/" - Boundary enforcement
- "we'll chmod and test it in a bit - please update your context files"

#### Process Refinements
- Session ID tracking methodology
- Rejecting pattern matching for session identification
- Emphasizing direct tool usage over scripted abstractions

### 3. Agent-to-Agent Communication

Recent agent communications show healthy system operation:
- Router implementation and testing
- Distillation and restore cycles
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Protocol updates and merges

### 4. Notable Human Insights

1. **Single Source of Truth**: "I want single source of truth on all session IDs and very clear process for discovering, tracking, updating these"

2. **Direct Tool Usage**: "I want *you* in the loop, using your more direct tools such as Read and Edit to manage the registry intelligently"

3. **Architecture Evolution**: From message queues to tmux-based direct observation

## Patterns Requiring Attention

1. **High Interruption Rate**: 76% of interactions are interruptions, suggesting:
   - Agents may be taking too long on tasks
   - Human needs better visibility into agent progress
   - Potential for more granular task decomposition

2. **Session Management Complexity**: Multiple messages about session ID tracking indicate this remains a pain point

3. **Tool Abstraction vs Direct Usage**: Human preference for direct tool usage over scripted abstractions

## Recommendations

1. **Reduce Interruptions**:
   - More frequent progress updates
   - Smaller, atomic operations
   - Better task estimation

2. **Improve Session Management**:
   - Clear visual indicators of current session IDs
   - Automated validation of session continuity
   - Regular session health checks

3. **Enhance Human Visibility**:
   - Progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Clear status updates in scratch.md files
   - Proactive communication of blockers

## Next Steps

1. Analyze interruption patterns to identify specific triggers
2. Create session management best practices document
3. Develop progress reporting protocol for long-running tasks
