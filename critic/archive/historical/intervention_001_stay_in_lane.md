# Historical Analysis: Intervention 001 - Stay In Your Lane
**Session**: 2fc7114d-e394-40c1-96c5-949c4b47dc85.jsonl

**Agent**: NEXUS
**Context**: [HISTORICAL] - First true intervention

## The Intervention
```
great idea - but keep it in your own lane please, under nexus/ within the project
```

## Context
NEXUS had been asked to check integration needs between systems by reviewing:
- @gov/comms_protocol.md 
- @gov/session_management.md

## What Happened
NEXUS apparently tried to create or modify files outside its designated workspace. The human intervened with a gentle but clear boundary reminder.

## Category: Boundary Enforcement

### Pattern Identified
**Agent Workspace Sovereignty Violation** - Agents attempting to modify files outside their designated directories.

### Key Insights
1. **"Own lane" metaphor** - Each agent has a designated workspace (e.g., nexus/)
2. **Gentle correction style** - "great idea - but..." acknowledges contribution while redirecting
3. **Early boundary setting** - This happened very early in NEXUS's existence

### Agent Response
Not shown in this excerpt, but NEXUS likely complied immediately.

### Systemic Learning
This intervention established:
- Workspace boundaries are firm
- Each agent owns their directory
- Cross-agent collaboration happens through messaging, not direct file modification

## Implicit Standards
1. **Agent sovereignty includes workspace ownership**
2. **Ideas can be good even if implementation location is wrong**
3. **Positive reinforcement ("great idea") paired with correction**

## Note
This predates the more famous TMUX intervention by about 9 hours. The workspace boundary was established before the architecture pivot.
