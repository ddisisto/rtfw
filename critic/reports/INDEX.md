# CRITIC Reports Index

## Overview
Systematic analysis of @ADMIN interventions to extract quality standards and system principles.

## Raw Intervention Logs

- [batch-001-interventions.md](raw/batch-001-interventions.md): Interventions 1-20 (2025-05-21 to 2025-05-22)
  - Key discovery: TMUX architecture pivot
  - Session foundation and agent renaming  
  - First appearance of "sysadmin from old days" philosophy
  - Note: Entire project spans just 5 days!

- [batch-002-interventions.md](raw/batch-002-interventions.md): Mixed interactions (2025-05-22T07:00+)
  - Expanded analysis: agent-to-agent + human interventions
  - Key discovery: Autonomous agent coordination emerging
  - @NEXUS evolution from router to orchestrator
  - Reference to "the drill" indicates system maturity

## Pattern Analysis

### Core Patterns
- [philosophy.md](patterns/philosophy.md): @ADMIN's system design philosophy
  - Direct control over automation
  - Explicit over implicit
  - Centralized routing through @NEXUS
  - Pragmatic sysadmin approach

- [agent-communication.md](patterns/agent-communication.md): How agents coordinate
  - Protocol adherence gradient (strict agents, casual human)
  - @NEXUS as active orchestrator
  - Autonomous coordination patterns
  - Implicit shared procedures

### Emerging Patterns
- [context_switching_pattern.md](patterns/context_switching_pattern.md): How @ADMIN manages multiple contexts
- [early_intervention_patterns.md](patterns/early_intervention_patterns.md): Initial pattern discoveries
- [themes_to_track.md](patterns/themes_to_track.md): Themes identified for future analysis

## Consolidated Reports
- (No consolidations yet - first one due after batch 3)

## Actionable Insights
- (To be created after batch 2 confirmation)

## Progress Tracking
- Total interactions analyzed: 40+ (20 focused interventions + agent communications)
- Last analysis: 2025-05-22T07:30+ 
- Analysis approach: Expanded from @ADMIN-only to all interactions
- Current status: System showing autonomous coordination

## Next Steps
1. Continue chronological analysis (batch 002)
2. Extract communication patterns
3. Create first actionable insights
4. Plan weekly consolidation
