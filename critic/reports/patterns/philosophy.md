# @ADMIN Intervention Patterns Analysis

## Overview
Analyzed 20 interventions from 2025-05-21T06:28:57.182Z onwards
Files analyzed from /home/daniel/prj/rtfw/nexus/sessions/

## Key Intervention Categories

### 1. **Directive Messages** (55% - 11 instances)
These involve @ADMIN routing messages between agents or providing specific instructions:
- Message routing using `@FROM → @TO` format
- Often spaced out character-by-character (e.g., "@ N E X U S → @ G O V")
- Examples:
  - "@NEXUS → @GOV: Direct communication established..."
  - "github is already setup @NEXUS → @GOV: Local git repository..."

### 2. **Process Corrections** (20% - 4 instances)
@ADMIN intervenes to correct approach or methodology:
- "wait, I have a better idea..." (introducing tmux approach)
- "nope, don't want to use pattern matching..." (correcting session ID approach)
- "I want *you* in the loop..." (correcting over-automation)

### 3. **Context Reminders** (15% - 3 instances)
Reminding agents to check or update context:
- "please check @ADMIN.md for some further notes..."
- "we'll chmod and test it in a bit - please update your context files..."

### 4. **Clarifications** (10% - 2 instances)
Providing additional context or fixing misunderstandings:
- "hrmm, the cut was too short, no useful context..."
- "I've reviewed - code and gov are the wrong way around..."

## Critical Patterns Observed

### Pattern 1: Session Continuation After Context Loss
**Context:** First intervention shows @ADMIN providing a compressed summary after context window exceeded
**Pattern:** When context is lost, @ADMIN provides structured summary with:
- Chronological breakdown of work done
- Key decisions made
- Technical details implemented
- Pending tasks
- Current work status

### Pattern 2: Shift from Automation to Direct Control
**Evolution observed:**
1. Initial: Agent proposes automated message queue system
2. @ADMIN intervenes: "wait, I have a better idea. We use tmux..."
3. Shift to @NEXUS directly managing terminals
4. Later refinement: @ADMIN wants @NEXUS "in the loop" not just automated

**Learning:** @ADMIN prefers direct agent control over automated systems

### Pattern 3: Session Management Philosophy
**Key interventions:**
- Against pattern matching for session identification
- Preference for explicit tracking using known session IDs
- Direct validation through agent prompts ("Agent ID Check")
- Registry managed directly by @NEXUS using Read/Edit tools

### Pattern 4: Communication Protocol
**Observations:**
- Heavy use of `@FROM → @TO` format
- Messages often character-spaced (possibly for clarity in terminal)
- Direct routing through @NEXUS as central hub
- No automated message passing - everything goes through @NEXUS

## @ADMIN's Core Preferences

1. **Explicit over Implicit**
   - Direct session ID tracking vs pattern matching
   - Clear agent identification vs inference
   - Manual registry updates vs automated discovery

2. **Centralized Control**
   - @NEXUS as single routing point
   - Direct tmux terminal management
   - No distributed message queues

3. **Pragmatic Solutions**
   - "I'm a sysadmin from old days, we can totally make this work!"
   - Preference for proven tools (tmux, terminals)
   - Avoiding over-engineering

4. **Context Awareness**
   - Frequent reminders to check/update context files
   - Emphasis on agents maintaining their own state
   - Clear delineation of responsibilities

## Intervention Timing Patterns

- **Early phase (05:57-13:50)**: Setting up basic infrastructure
- **Mid phase (13:36-02:40)**: Refining approach, major pivots
- **Later phase (06:14+)**: Message routing, operational coordination

Most corrections happen when:
1. Agent proposes overly complex solution
2. Agent misunderstands system architecture
3. Context needs refreshing after breaks
4. New operational phase begins

## Key Learnings for Agents

1. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid over-engineered solutions
2. **Check Context First**: Many issues stem from outdated context
3. **Direct Control**: Prefer direct tool usage over automation
4. **Clear Communication**: Use established protocols exactly
5. **Session Hygiene**: Maintain accurate session tracking always

## Technical Implementation Details

From interventions, the established system uses:
- tmux for terminal management
- Direct file operations (Read/Edit) for state
- Git commits for message passing
- Session IDs in registry.md
- Character-spaced messages for clarity
- @NEXUS as central routing hub

This approach reflects @ADMIN's background as a sysadmin - practical, reliable, and directly observable.
