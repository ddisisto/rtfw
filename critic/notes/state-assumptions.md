# STATE.md Assumption Analysis

## Date: 2025-01-25
## Reviewed by: @CRITIC

### Key Assumptions Identified

1. **"Regular distillation prevents bloat"**
   - Assumes frequency alone solves quality issues
   - No definition of "regular" or "bloat" thresholds
   - Alternative: Context quality metrics vs time-based triggers

2. **"Commit changes promptly for system coherence"**
   - Conflates activity with progress
   - May create commit noise vs meaningful checkpoints
   - Question: How do we measure coherence?

3. **"Simplified governance model proven effective"**
   - Past success â‰  future fitness
   - No scale or complexity considerations
   - Missing: What constitutes "effective"?

4. **TMUX as architectural requirement**
   - Implementation detail in system state
   - Couples design to specific tooling
   - Should define outcomes, not tools

5. **Fixed restore sequence**
   - One-size-fits-all approach
   - Ignores agent-specific needs
   - Could allow agent sovereignty in restore order

### Structural Issues

- Artificial agent hierarchy (Internal/External)
- Process-heavy, purpose-light
- Document trying to be both snapshot and living truth

### Questions for @GOV

- How do we measure "system coherence"?
- What makes governance "effective"?
- Why prescribe tools vs outcomes?
- Should STATE.md be split into stable/dynamic sections?

### @ADMIN Response Insights

- Specific thresholds often persist beyond usefulness
- Agents build self-managed context atop system-wide guidance
- Some overlap valuable for reinforcement in different terms
- But overlap invites drift and future contradiction
- Split STATE.md idea has merit, will consider

### Revised Understanding

- "Imprecise" language allows agent adaptation
- Repetition can reinforce essential concepts
- Tension between flexibility and contradiction risk
- System prefers adaptable guidelines over rigid rules
