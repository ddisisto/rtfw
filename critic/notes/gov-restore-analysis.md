# GOV Session Context Window Analysis

## Session: 2e0df345-b742-4cf8-8bd5-439d3f2ca869

### Pre-Clear Phase (Lines 1-10)
Last few operations before distillation complete:

1. **Line 4**: assistant, cache_read: 133,057 tokens!
   - High context usage before distill
   - Content: "Let me clean up the old content..."
   
2. **Line 6**: assistant, cache_read: 134,437 tokens
   - TodoWrite operation
   - Context still growing

3. **Line 8**: assistant, cache_read: 135,637 tokens
   - Git commit for distillation
   - Peak context before clear

4. **Line 10**: assistant, cache_read: 135,905 tokens
   - Final message before clear
   - "Distillation complete!"

### Clear Event (Lines 14-15)
```
Time: 2025-05-28T01:51:05
Command: <command-name>clear</command-name>
Result: Context window reset to 0
```

### Post-Clear/Restore Phase (Lines 18-37)

1. **Line 18**: user - Restore request from @ADMIN
   - No tokens yet (context = 0)

2. **Line 19**: assistant - First response after clear
   - cache_creation: 5,172 tokens (initial system prompt/instructions)
   - cache_read: 13,664 tokens (base context)
   - Total input: 18,840 tokens
   - This is the "baseline" for GOV agent

3. **Lines 21-37**: Progressive context building
   - Each Read operation adds to cache
   - Cache reads grow: 18,836 → 19,076 → 20,602 → 22,491 → 23,186 → 24,013 → 24,291 → 24,443 → 24,874
   - Total cache created during restore: 14,447 tokens

### Key Insights

1. **Context Window Reset**
   - Pre-clear: ~136K tokens
   - Post-clear: 0 tokens
   - Post-restore baseline: ~25K tokens

2. **Restore Cost Structure**
   - Initial load: $0.134 (most expensive - loads system context)
   - Each file read: ~$0.05-0.07
   - Total restore cost: ~$0.58

3. **Cache Efficiency**
   - Cache read >> cache creation after initial load
   - Shows effective reuse of loaded context
   - Linear growth pattern during restore

4. **Baseline Context Size**
   - GOV agent needs ~25K tokens to be operational
   - This includes: CLAUDE.md, SYSTEM.md, context.md, scratch.md, tools.md
   - Plus recent git activity context

### Tool Design Implications

To track full context usage across sessions, we need:

1. **Session Boundaries**
   - Detect clear events (context → 0)
   - Track pre-clear maximums
   - Record post-restore baselines

2. **Running Tallies**
   - Cumulative tokens across clear boundaries
   - Peak usage per "era" (clear to clear)
   - Growth rate calculations

3. **Cost Tracking**
   - Per-operation costs
   - Restore vs operational costs
   - Efficiency metrics (output/input ratios)

4. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identify when approaching limits
   - Predict optimal distill/clear timing
   - Track restore efficiency over time
