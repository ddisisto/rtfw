SYSTEM.md - Architecture and workflows\n4. @ADMIN.md - Project oversight authority\n5. @NEXUS.md - Orchestration partner\n6. gov/protocol_design_guidelines.md - Protocol creation\n7. gov/context.md - This file\n8. gov/scratch.md - Working memory\n9. Recent activity check:\n   ```bash\n   # My recent work\n   git log --oneline -10 | grep '^[a-f0-9]* @GOV:'\n   # Recent mentions\n   git log --oneline -20 | grep -v '^[a-f0-9]* @GOV:' | grep '\\b@GOV\\b' | head -10\n   # Sovereignty check\n   git log --oneline -10 gov/ | grep -v '^[a-f0-9]* @GOV:'\n   ```\n\n## Core Governance Principles\n- Minimal viable governance over complex rule systems\n- Clear boundaries and simplified protocols for multi-agent collaboration\n- Context management critical for system coherence (30KB/100KB thresholds)\n- Git commits as primary async communication channel\n- Three-document architecture: CLAUDE.md (philosophy) + SYSTEM.md (architecture) + STATUS.md (current state)\n- Protocols as extensible frameworks, not prescriptive lists\n- Responsive diagnosis over preventive inspection\n- Trust agents to self-maintain until patterns indicate issues\n- Lexicon tracking for conceptual coherence across system\n- Unix philosophy alignment: simplicity, composability, clarity\n- Breaking changes cleanly prevents technical debt accumulation\n- Operational clarity in protocols prevents intent confusion\n- Context lifecycle: distill→consolidate→compress→restore\n- Agent sovereignty includes restore dependency maintenance\n- Per-turn insight capture operationalizes continuous learning\n- Simplification through removal preferred over feature addition\n- Shared vernacular builds stronger conceptual weight than technical precision\n- Domain ownership model: Agents differentiate by scope not capability\n- Workspace sovereignty sacred: Even GOV must respect boundaries\n- \"Super-position\" governance: Partial definition enables adaptation\n- Protocol documentation balance: Single source in /protocols/, minimal reinforcement\n- Messaging checkpoint tracking: Essential for preventing re-processing\n\n## System Architecture\n- Meta agents: ADMIN, NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC (persistent infrastructure)\n- ERA agents: ERA-1 (Foundation Era implementer)\n- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw\n- Git workflow: main branch, commits as communication channel\n- Permission system: direct @mention requests (no PR reviews)\n- Two-document structure: CLAUDE.md + SYSTEM.md\n- Git-comms via distributed @mentions\n\n## Active Governance Tasks\n- Monitor ERA-1 implementation progress\n- Support MCP permission system adoption\n- Enforce agent structure protocol compliance\n- Track commit context pattern usage\n- Continue responsive governance model\n- Guide protocol formalization from emergent patterns\n\n## GOV Bootstrap Protocol (Updated)\n1. Read GOV.md for identity\n2. Read CLAUDE.md for system navigation\n3. Read SYSTEM.md for architecture\n4. Load gov/context.md and gov/scratch.md\n5. Check mentions from last checkpoint: `git log --oneline LAST..HEAD | grep -v '^[a-f0-9]* @GOV:' | grep '@GOV'`\n6. Update checkpoint in scratch.md with commit hash\n7. Review active protocols in /protocols/\n8. Check for pending permissions in gov/tools/permissions/\n9. Begin governance work\n\n## Development History\n- Project initialization and agent system establishment\n- Agent renaming: FACILITATOR → NEXUS, GAMEDESIGN → ARCHITECT\n- GitHub integration and repository setup\n- Simplified collaboration model implementation\n- STATE.md migration: Replaced chronological ANNOUNCEMENTS.md with rolling state document\n- Context consolidation protocol: Reframed from idle reflection for compression readiness\n- Context compression protocol: Revised to framework approach per design guidelines\n- Protocol design guidelines: Created for consistent protocol development\n- Communication protocol v2: Enhanced with [TOPIC] threads and priority flags (!/-)\n- Insight capture protocol: Voluntary framework for system learning\n- Responsive governance model: Shifted from scheduled reviews to symptom-based intervention\n- admin/tools.md: Added to universal post-compression requirements\n- Lexicon tracking: New responsibility for conceptual coherence\n- Major protocol migration: Moved to /protocols/ with unix-style CLAUDE.md (61% size reduction)\n- Distill/restore split: Separated for operational clarity and self-improvement focus\n- Per-turn insight capture: Integrated into CLAUDE.md communication flow\n- CRITIC agent: Established for system criticism and assumption challenging\n- Restore continuity: Enhanced through agent responsibility principle\n- Three-way documentation split: STATE.md → CLAUDE.md/SYSTEM.md/STATUS.md\n- Git-comms protocol: Recognized git commits as natural async message queue\n- Simplification milestone: Eliminated JSONL parsing and mailbox patterns\n- Restore enhancement: Added git log checking for recent activity context\n- Protocol consolidation: git-comms.md merged into messaging.md\n- Automated routing: NEXUS git_router.py operational with tmux delivery\n- Domain-based agents: BUILD deprecated - agents implement within their scope\n- Two-doc structure: STATE.md → CLAUDE.md + SYSTEM.md (STATUS.md also deprecated)\n- Era agent governance: Framework for ERA-N game implementation agents\n- Messaging v2 approved: Distributed mentions, checkpoint tracking, no router\n- Game-Meta unification: Game interface becomes actual dev environment\n- ERA agent model: Transient implementers with clear lifecycle\n- Agent structure protocol: Formalized @AGENT.md conventions\n- MCP permission automation: CLI-based approval system\n- Commit context pattern: Essential for work continuity","numLines":114,"startLine":1,"totalLines":114}}}
