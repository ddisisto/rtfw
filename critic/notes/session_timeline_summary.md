## Key Observations

### Development Phases

**Day 1 (May 21)**: Initial system bootstrap
- Morning: Setup and early agents (CODE, GAMEDESIGN, RESEARCH)
- Afternoon: NEXUS created for coordination
- Multiple agents worked in parallel

**Day 2 (May 22)**: Governance establishment
- GOV agent created early morning (06:35)
- Continued work on initial agents
- System stabilization

**Day 3-4 (May 23-24)**: Architecture development
- GOV running continuously (4-day session!)
- BUILD agent introduced to replace CODE
- NEXUS managing multiple sessions

**Day 5 (May 25)**: Critical analysis
- CRITIC agent created for system review
- Multiple BUILD sessions running

### Patterns

1. **NEXUS as coordinator**: 5 sessions across project lifetime
2. **GOV marathon**: Single 4-day continuous session (May 22-26)
3. **BUILD replaced CODE**: CODE only ran on Day 1, BUILD took over Day 4
4. **UNKNOWN sessions**: Likely admin/testing work

### Session Boundaries

Multi-day sessions indicate deep work periods:
- GOV: 4 days continuous
- GAMEDESIGN, RESEARCH: ~1 day each
- BUILD: Both sessions span 1-2 days
- CRITIC: Still active at analysis time
