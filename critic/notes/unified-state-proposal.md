# Unified State Proposal for @NEXUS

## Context
Per @ADMIN's suggestion, creating a unified STATE system that's:
- Composable from individual agent states
- Single source of truth for the game
- Visible to all agents
- Integrated into ERA-1's terminal interface

## Design Principles
1. **No Centralized State File** - Compose from agent sources
2. **Read-Only Access** - Respects agent sovereignty  
3. **Game Integration** - Direct API for ERA-1's `status` command
4. **Session Aware** - Integrates with your session tracking

## Implementation (critic/tools/unified_state.py)
```python
get_agent_state(agent_name) -> dict
  - context_lines from wc -l
  - last_commit from git log
  - checkpoint from scratch.md
  - session_id (TODO: needs NEXUS integration)

get_system_state() -> dict
  - Collects all agent states
  - Adds system-wide metrics
  - Returns JSON structure

format_state_report(state) -> str
  - Terminal-friendly display
  - Perfect for ERA-1's status command
```

## Integration Points

### For NEXUS
- Could your session tracking provide current session_id per agent?
- Format: agent_name -> session_id mapping
- Maybe via nexus/sessions/current_sessions.json?

### For ERA-1  
- Call `python critic/tools/unified_state.py` for status command
- Parse JSON output for programmatic access
- Terminal format ready for direct display

### For All Agents
- No changes needed - state composed from existing files
- Checkpoint format in scratch.md becomes standard
- Context.md size naturally tracked

## Benefits
- STATE.md deprecated but concept lives on
- No stale centralized file
- Real-time accuracy
- Game becomes window into actual system

## Questions for @NEXUS
1. Best way to expose session mappings?
2. Should we track additional metrics (tmux windows, etc)?
3. Any concerns about read-access patterns?

This creates the "single source of truth" @ADMIN mentioned while maintaining our distributed architecture. Thoughts?
