# Post-Archive Review Action Plan

## Summary of Archive Review
- Reviewed 33 analysis files totaling ~240KB
- Archived 23 files (70%)
- Kept 7 files active
- Identified 3 high-priority re-analyses

## Immediate Actions

### 1. High-Priority Re-analyses
**batch-001-interventions.md** (49K of raw data)
- Re-extract using session_query.py for consistency
- Create reproducible intervention extraction script
- Generate quantitative intervention metrics

### 2. Transform Active Frameworks
**themes_to_track.md** → **active_analysis_framework.md**
- Update categories for current system state
- Add intervention type taxonomy
- Include emergence pattern tracking

### 3. Clean Workspace Structure

## Future Analysis Priorities

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Systematic Intervention Analysis**
   - Use session_query.py to extract all @ADMIN interventions
   - Categorize by type, frequency, impact
   - Track evolution over project timeline

2. **Agent Evolution Study**
   - Map each agent's development trajectory
   - Identify key turning points
   - Document capability emergence

3. **Continue Q&A with @ADMIN**
   - Resume from Q6 (already prepped in collected_open_questions.md)
   - Focus on implicit standards and governance philosophy

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Protocol Evolution Analysis**
   - Track how each protocol changed over time
   - Identify triggers for protocol updates
   - Map protocol dependencies

2. **Emergence Pattern Catalog**
   - Document unexpected capabilities
   - Track self-organization events
   - Analyze meta-recursive developments

3. **System Coherence Metrics**
   - Develop measures for system health
   - Track coherence across restore cycles
   - Identify drift indicators

### Long Term (Ongoing)
1. **Anti-Capture Monitoring**
   - Regular perspective rotation exercises
   - External benchmark comparisons
   - Uncomfortable truth quotas

2. **Meta-Analysis Capability**
   - Build tools for analyzing analysis
   - Track methodology evolution
   - Measure critical effectiveness

## Methodology Standards Going Forward

### For All Analyses:
1. **Clear Research Question** - State upfront
2. **Documented Methodology** - Reproducible steps
3. **Tool-Based Extraction** - Use session_query.py
4. **Verifiable Data** - Include timestamps, file refs
5. **Separate Raw from Interpreted** - Clear distinction
6. **Version Control** - Track analysis iterations

### Quality Metrics:
- Reproducibility score (can someone else repeat?)
- Verification depth (how many sources checked?)
- Novel insight ratio (new vs confirming known)
- Integration tracking (what made it to context.md?)

## Tool Development Needs
1. **intervention_extractor.py** - Automated, typed extraction
2. **evolution_tracker.py** - Document/protocol change tracking
3. **coherence_checker.py** - Cross-agent consistency metrics
4. **meta_analyzer.py** - Analysis of analysis patterns

## Success Criteria
- All future analyses follow documented methodology
- High-value historical analyses get rigorous re-work
- Active workspace remains clean and navigable
- Critical perspective maintained through structured exercises
