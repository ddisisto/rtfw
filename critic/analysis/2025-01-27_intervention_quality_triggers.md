# Understanding @ADMIN's Quality Triggers Through Intervention Analysis
Started: 2025-01-27
Status: COMPLETE

## Research Question
What specific conditions trigger @ADMIN interventions, and what do these reveal about implicit quality standards for AI development?

## Sub-Questions
1. What agent behaviors consistently trigger corrections?
2. How do intervention patterns change as agents mature?
3. What's the ratio of preventive guidance vs corrective intervention?
4. Which quality standards are explicit vs discovered through practice?

## Methodology
1. Extract ALL @ADMIN messages from sessions (2025-05-21 to 2025-05-26)
   - Include full context (3 messages before/after)
   - Preserve exact timestamps and session IDs
   
2. Categorize by trigger type:
   - **Boundary Violation** - Cross-workspace access
   - **Tool Misuse** - Shell vs native, batching errors
   - **Architecture Drift** - Deviating from design principles
   - **Efficiency Loss** - Over-engineering, wrong abstractions
   - **Progress Stall** - Taking too long, going in circles
   - **Quality Issue** - Code standards, testing, documentation
   
3. Analyze intervention characteristics:
   - Tone (supportive/corrective/directive)
   - Teaching method (explanation/example/redirection)
   - Preventive vs reactive timing
   
4. Track evolution patterns:
   - Do certain trigger types decrease over time?
   - Which lessons stick vs need repetition?
   - How quickly do agents adapt?

## Data Sources
- [x] Sessions: nexus/sessions/session_2025-05-2[1-6]_*.jsonl
- [ ] Git commits: Correlation with intervention timing
- [ ] Agent responses: How corrections were received/implemented

## Tools & Commands
```bash
# Extract all @ADMIN messages with context
python critic/tools/session_query.py \
  --query "@ADMIN" \
  --context 3 \
  --output critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_admin_messages_raw.json

# Filter for actual interventions (not just mentions)
python critic/tools/session_query.py \
  --input critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_admin_messages_raw.json \
  --filter "user_type:human" \
  --output critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_interventions.json
```

## Expected Outputs
- [ ] Raw intervention data → outputs/2025-01-27_interventions.json
- [ ] Categorized triggers → outputs/2025-01-27_quality_triggers.csv
- [ ] Evolution timeline → outputs/2025-01-27_intervention_timeline.json
- [ ] Quality standards extracted → This file's findings section

## Success Criteria
- Clear mapping of trigger → intervention → outcome
- Quantified patterns (not just anecdotes)
- Actionable quality standards for agents
- Understanding of human-AI collaboration dynamics

## Findings

### Summary
Analyzed 123 @ADMIN interventions from 2025-05-21 to 2025-05-27, revealing clear quality standards and evolution patterns. Key finding: The system rapidly learned from early corrections, with architectural/efficiency issues dropping from 50% to 0% over 6 days.

### Detailed Results

#### Category Distribution (n=123)
1. **DIRECTIVE** - 104 (84.6%) - General guidance and task assignment
2. **SUPPORTIVE** - 43 (35.0%) - Encouragement and approval
3. **QUALITY_ISSUE** - 39 (31.7%) - Testing, verification, git practices
4. **EFFICIENCY_LOSS** - 18 (14.6%) - Over-engineering, batching errors
5. **PROGRESS_STALL** - 12 (9.8%) - Interruptions, redirections
6. **TOOL_MISUSE** - 7 (5.7%) - Native vs shell tool violations
7. **ARCHITECTURE_DRIFT** - 6 (4.9%) - Design deviations
8. **BOUNDARY_VIOLATION** - 1 (0.8%) - Workspace sovereignty breach

#### Tone Analysis
- **Neutral** - 32.5% - Matter-of-fact guidance
- **Supportive** - 23.6% - "great!", "perfect!", "nice!"
- **Questioning** - 20.3% - Socratic teaching method
- **Corrective** - 11.4% - "nope", "wait", "stop"
- **Enthusiastic** - 6.5% - High energy engagement
- **Apologetic** - 5.7% - "my bad", "sorry"

#### Key Quality Standards Revealed

1. **Tool Discipline** (5.7% of interventions)
   - "Read > cat", "Glob > find", "native > shell always"
   - Violations trigger immediate correction
   - @admin/tools.md established as reference

2. **Workspace Sovereignty** (0.8% but foundational)
   - "keep it in your own lane" - only 1 instance needed
   - Agents learned quickly not to modify outside directories
   - Core architectural principle established early

3. **Git Hygiene** (31.7% include quality aspects)
   - Regular commits required after changes
   - Clear commit messages
   - "git add agent/" universally permitted

4. **Efficiency Standards** (14.6% of interventions)
   - "one at a time please, don't batch"
   - Direct implementation over abstraction
   - Simplicity preferred

5. **Architecture Coherence** (4.9% but high impact)
   - TMUX pivot: "wait, I have a better idea"
   - Single session, multiple windows (not separate sessions)
   - Direct observation over complex abstractions

### Evolution Patterns

#### Learning Success Story
- **Day 1** (May 21): 50% architecture/efficiency issues
- **Day 7** (May 27): 0% architecture/efficiency issues
- Clear learning demonstrated across all problem categories

#### Tool Misuse Timeline
- Days 1-3: 0% (not yet established)
- Day 4: Peak at 16% (standards being taught)
- Days 5-6: Drops to 6% then 0% (learned)

#### Tone Evolution
- Early: 50% corrective (Day 1)
- Middle: 40% supportive (Day 2) 
- Late: 100% supportive (Day 7)
- Pattern: Corrections → Guidance → Encouragement

#### Question Frequency
- Average 43.9% of interventions are questions
- Peak on Day 2 (64%) during heavy teaching
- Socratic method prevalent throughout

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH**: Category distributions, tone analysis, evolution patterns
- **MEDIUM**: Learning indicators (based on limited late-stage data)
- **LOW**: Long-term retention (beyond 7-day window)

### Contradictions/Surprises
1. Only 1 boundary violation despite being core principle
2. Tool misuse emerged late (Day 4) not early
3. Questions more common than directives
4. Apologetic tone from authority figure (5.7%)
