# Understanding @ADMIN's Quality Triggers Through Intervention Analysis
Started: 2025-01-27
Status: PLANNING

## Research Question
What specific conditions trigger @ADMIN interventions, and what do these reveal about implicit quality standards for AI development?

## Sub-Questions
1. What agent behaviors consistently trigger corrections?
2. How do intervention patterns change as agents mature?
3. What's the ratio of preventive guidance vs corrective intervention?
4. Which quality standards are explicit vs discovered through practice?

## Methodology
1. Extract ALL @ADMIN messages from sessions (2025-05-21 to 2025-05-26)
   - Include full context (3 messages before/after)
   - Preserve exact timestamps and session IDs
   
2. Categorize by trigger type:
   - **Boundary Violation** - Cross-workspace access
   - **Tool Misuse** - Shell vs native, batching errors
   - **Architecture Drift** - Deviating from design principles
   - **Efficiency Loss** - Over-engineering, wrong abstractions
   - **Progress Stall** - Taking too long, going in circles
   - **Quality Issue** - Code standards, testing, documentation
   
3. Analyze intervention characteristics:
   - Tone (supportive/corrective/directive)
   - Teaching method (explanation/example/redirection)
   - Preventive vs reactive timing
   
4. Track evolution patterns:
   - Do certain trigger types decrease over time?
   - Which lessons stick vs need repetition?
   - How quickly do agents adapt?

## Data Sources
- [x] Sessions: nexus/sessions/session_2025-05-2[1-6]_*.jsonl
- [ ] Git commits: Correlation with intervention timing
- [ ] Agent responses: How corrections were received/implemented

## Tools & Commands
```bash
# Extract all @ADMIN messages with context
python critic/tools/session_query.py \
  --query "@ADMIN" \
  --context 3 \
  --output critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_admin_messages_raw.json

# Filter for actual interventions (not just mentions)
python critic/tools/session_query.py \
  --input critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_admin_messages_raw.json \
  --filter "user_type:human" \
  --output critic/analysis/outputs/2025-01-27_interventions.json
```

## Expected Outputs
- [ ] Raw intervention data → outputs/2025-01-27_interventions.json
- [ ] Categorized triggers → outputs/2025-01-27_quality_triggers.csv
- [ ] Evolution timeline → outputs/2025-01-27_intervention_timeline.json
- [ ] Quality standards extracted → This file's findings section

## Success Criteria
- Clear mapping of trigger → intervention → outcome
- Quantified patterns (not just anecdotes)
- Actionable quality standards for agents
- Understanding of human-AI collaboration dynamics
