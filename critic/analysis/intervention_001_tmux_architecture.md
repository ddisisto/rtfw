# Intervention Analysis #001: TMUX Architecture Redirect

## Session Details
- File: ce51677e-8f35-45e0-984d-6dc767ec416e.jsonl
- Line: 48
- Timestamp: 2025-05-22T02:40:21.558Z
- Agent: NEXUS

## Context Before Intervention
NEXUS was building a message queue system with individual agent inboxes:
- Creating directories for each agent's inbox
- Building file-based message passing
- Implementing complex queue management

## The Intervention
```
wait, I have a better idea. We use tmux and terminals - you @NEXUS directly run these, 
maintain state of all agents in their respective terminals, directly watch all outputs 
for messages to pass, approve proposed actions if in line with policies, convene with 
@GOV when in doubt. I'll be known as @ADMIN instead of all those other terms we've had. 
I'm a sysadmin from old days, we can totally make this work!
```

## Category: Structural Redirection

### Pattern Identified
**Overengineering Simple Problems** - Agent was building a complex file-based message queue system when a simpler solution using existing tools (tmux) would suffice.

### Key Insights
1. **@ADMIN's Background Influences Design** - "I'm a sysadmin from old days" reveals preference for Unix-style solutions over abstracted systems
2. **Real-time vs Async** - Shift from async file queues to real-time terminal monitoring
3. **Tool Reuse** - Leverage existing tmux capabilities instead of building new infrastructure
4. **Simplification** - Direct output monitoring vs complex queue management

### Agent Response
NEXUS immediately accepted: "Brilliant! A tmux-based approach is much more elegant."
- No resistance
- Recognized elegance of simpler solution
- Quickly pivoted to new architecture

### Systemic Blindness Revealed
Agents tend to build new systems rather than leverage existing tools. This suggests:
- Insufficient awareness of available system capabilities
- Tendency to solve at wrong abstraction level
- Missing "Unix philosophy" of composing simple tools

### Implicit Quality Standard
@ADMIN values:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Proven tools over custom solutions
- Real-world experience over theoretical elegance
- Direct observation over indirect mechanisms

## Recommendations
1. Add to agent training: "Check if existing tools solve the problem before building new ones"
2. Emphasize Unix philosophy in CLAUDE.md more strongly
3. Consider a "tool inventory" that agents review before designing solutions
4. Encourage "What would a sysadmin do?" thinking
