I can also switch session to interact directly with any of the individual agents. I think what we really need next is a game loop, of sorts - you distribute messages between other agents and myself, then loop looking for sessions waiting for input, approvals, etc. If an agent has nothing to do for the present time it can be left idle until something for it comes up.

Your messaging and session / window management is seeming really solid now, but we have really tried using the main loop approach fully as yet. In order to get there, I'd like to first more clearly define the bigger picture and session flow. In short - 1. agent started / resumed / just underwent context compression, is waiting for input. 2. we prompt it for first/next step (i.e. if post-compression, give them @gov/context_compression_protocol.md and ask to load reload required context). This must always re-affirm their AGENT name and role as both the TO and @AGENT.md . 3. regular main loop - I think this requires significant review and simplification next (prompt -> agent does stuff (with tool approvals if needed) -> read only final output, repeat). 4. We'll get you to detect when context compression needed and manage that in-line. I'm think that all agent's input & output will consist entirely of comms_protocol following messages (which you're doing awesomely at for your output to me), exception for input if @ADMIN is sending direct inputs like I'm doing now as I type reaaaalllyy slowly compared to you lot ;) Let's work on this in a new doc perhaps, for either reference from or insertion into your context.md",

The reason this happens is that the final string on the input is and @file link, which causes a little auto-complete file select helper to show up and it swallows the first Enter. we can either do Enter twice, or re-arrange the prompt wording so that the file link comes earlier. I'd used this one with you previously, which would't have that issue, and seemed to work well - \"@ADMIN -> @NEXUS: @gov/context_compression_protocol.md completed for @NEXUS.md - please reload all relevant agent context for continuation\", but we'll need to ensure that the same issue doesn't occur in other situations anyway. A single trailing space would actually do the trick. (nb. I've cleared input field on gov now if you want to try it again)",

I can then look to cron running of this, and all going well, you pivot to processing and removing those unroutable ones primarily. might need to think about race conditions though, if you are both updating the file in place directly. not sure, could consider more inherently atomic approach if you have ideas. Oh, also, need special handling for @ADMIN - I have tmux window for myself to run terminal commands, etc but normal agent message delivery won't work there like in all other windows. maybe append these to admin/inbox.txt only and I'll keep an eye on this for myself",
