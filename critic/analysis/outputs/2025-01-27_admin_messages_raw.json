We use tmux and terminals - you @NEXUS directly run these, maintain state of all agents in their respective terminals, directly watch all outputs for messages to pass, approve proposed actions if in line with policies, convene with @GOV when in doubt. I'll be known as @ADMIN instead of all those other terms we've had. I'm a sysadmin from old days, we can totally make this work!"}
