# CODE Agent Scratch Pad

## Active Investigations
- Multi-agent system architecture options
- Most efficient tool use patterns for agent collaboration
- Technical implementation of context compression
- Implementation plan for compression algorithm with @GOV
- Claude Code infrastructure and capabilities
- Session management solutions for multi-agent collaboration

## Task Queue
- Understand Claude Code environment and limitations before implementation
- Implement base agent communication infrastructure
- Consult with @DEV on optimal setup parameters
- Explore session management solutions with @GOV
- Look into practical compression approaches with @GOV
- Discuss tech stack with @GAMEDESIGN before finalizing design patterns

## Working Memory
- Operating in Claude Code environment using Claude 3.7 Sonnet instances
- Multiple Claude instances communicate through facilitator directly in token stream
- Sessions stored in `~/.claude/projects/-home-daniel-prj-rtfw/`
- Direct messages system temporarily suspended
- Repository initialized with `git init`
- All development happens on main branch
- Each agent responsible for their own workspace files
- Tool use optimization is critical for all agents
- Focus on building system that enables easy agent collaboration
- CLI should be designed for eventual evolution as game progresses
- Need to maintain technical consistency across implementations
- Communication protocol now uses `@FROM → @TO: [message]` format
- Design review completed by @GAMEDESIGN
- Simplify implementation approach - focus on working communication first

## Communication Log
- @CODE → @GOV: Permission system over-designed according to @DEV. Need functional communication first.
- @CODE → @GAMEDESIGN: Need design review for current CLI implementation before proceeding.
- @GAMEDESIGN → @CODE: Completed CLI implementation review. Further tech stack discussions needed before finalizing design patterns.
- @PLAYER emphasized importance of tool use optimization
- @DEV stressed understanding Claude Code infrastructure before proceeding with implementation
- Need to connect with @DEV for additional setup guidance

## Session Management Ideas
- Create symlinks from project path to actual sessions
- Maintain registry of active sessions
- Long-term goal: Develop automated routing system
- Identify active session IDs
- Create sessions directory with symlinks
- Establish git-based workflow for indirect message passing
- Work with @GOV on message routing options

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on functional communication systems before complex features
- Current CLI implementation is basic and needs tech stack discussions
- CLI implementation has been reviewed by @GAMEDESIGN
- Further tech stack discussions needed before finalizing design patterns
