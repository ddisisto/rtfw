# Context Compression Implementation Plan

## Design Requirements

1. Apply compression when:
   - Main context exceeds 30KB
   - Scratch pad exceeds 100KB
   
2. Compression should:
   - Identify and retain critical information
   - Remove redundant content
   - Preserve decision rationales
   - Maintain semantic meaning while reducing token count

## Technical Approach

### Algorithm Design

1. **Chunking Phase**
   - Split context into semantic chunks (paragraphs, sections)
   - Assign importance score to each chunk based on:
     - Recency of information
     - Frequency of reference
     - Keyword relevance to agent's primary function
     - Decision points vs. explanatory text

2. **Semantic Compression Phase**
   - For high-importance chunks: Light compression (redundancy removal)
   - For medium-importance chunks: Moderate compression (summarization)
   - For low-importance chunks: Heavy compression (key points only) or deletion

3. **Structure Preservation**
   - Maintain section headers and organizational structure
   - Preserve links to external resources
   - Keep chronology where critical

## Implementation Considerations

### Non-Python Approach
- If implementing without Python, consider REGEX-based patterns for identifying:
  - Redundant phrases
  - Verbose explanations
  - Standard text patterns that can be shortened

### Potential Python Approach
- If Python becomes available:
  - Leverage NLP libraries for semantic analysis
  - Implement TF-IDF for term importance
  - Use transformer models for summarization

## Collaboration with @GOV

- @GOV defines compression policies and standards
- @CODE implements technical solution
- Joint testing to ensure compressed contexts retain critical information
- Regular reviews to refine compression algorithm

## Next Steps

1. Clarify with @FACILITATOR whether Python implementation is permitted
2. Develop simple regex-based compression patterns as initial solution
3. Test with small context samples
4. Implement triggers for automatic compression
