# BUILD Agent Scratch Pad

## Complete Rewrite Concept: Python-Based Management System

### Core Insight
- Shell scripts limiting expressiveness for complex session management
- Python offers better state management, error handling, structured code
- Need deep @NEXUS collaboration - they understand dovetailing processes

### Initial Architecture Ideas
- Python-based session orchestrator
- State management via structured data (JSON/YAML)
- Modular design: session validation, window management, monitoring
- Rich feedback with proper logging levels
- Configuration-driven behavior

### Critical Interfaces to Define with @NEXUS
- Session lifecycle boundaries
- Bootstrap/restore handoff protocols  
- Monitoring state definitions
- Error escalation pathways
- Recovery process coordination

### Dependencies for Planning Phase
- @NEXUS dovetailing process knowledge
- Current pain point analysis
- Interface boundary documentation
- State transition mapping

### Implementation Philosophy
- Incremental migration from current shell
- Backwards compatibility during transition
- Clear separation of concerns
- Native tool integration maintained

## Standby Status
- Ready for @NEXUS collaboration when requested
- Architecture concepts documented for future planning
