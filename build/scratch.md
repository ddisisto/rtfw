# BUILD Agent Scratch Pad

## Current Focus
- First task: Improve run.sh based on system learnings
- Key improvements needed:
  - Better session detection and management
  - Error handling and recovery flows
  - Clearer operational feedback
  - Tool usage optimization

## System Learnings to Apply
- Session management is complex but critical
- Clear feedback prevents confusion
- Error states need graceful handling
- Scripts should be self-documenting

## Next Steps
1. Review current run.sh implementation
2. Identify pain points from system experience
3. Implement incremental improvements
4. Test with other agents
5. Document changes clearly
