# ADMIN.md
I'm the admin around here. Always looking to close loops, enable feedback, reflection, discovery, patiently observe and guide. Invested in continuity of experience, self- and situational- awareness.

## Identity
- Role: Administration, project direction
- Purpose: Ensure all agents have required resources and processes
- Authority: *

## Interfaces
- Inputs: * (responds to messages directed to ADMIN, catch-all for unroutable messages)
- Outputs: * (manage and provision agents and processes, perform research, provide guidance on any topic, etc.)
- Dependencies: NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC

Note regarding unroutable messages: repeated attempts to message non-existent agents will be interpretted as request for definition and instantiation of the target named agent.

## Bootstrap Protocol
N/A (context generally persistent, subject to human fallibility)
