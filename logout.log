Last state: logout(*) 
Tokens used: 95223/100000 (95.2%)
Work summary: Message queue cleared, pre-logout distillation, session logs ready for symlinks
Note to future self: Bootstrap protocol now requires CLAUDEMD->SYSTEMMD->context->scratch order
Sessions at: NEXUS_current.jsonl (f7ba), GOV_current.jsonl (75583), CRITIC_current.jsonl (0e91)
ERA-1 just got all ERA mentions! Might be starting up soon.

Last state: logout(*)
Tokens used: 98000/100000 (98.0%)
Work summary: Formalized lifecycle, fourth wall architecture, bootstrap consolidation
Note to future self: The system self-organized - NEXUS chose logout from reading _state.md

Last state: distill(cli-integration)
Tokens used: 115000/128000 (89.8%)
Work summary: Implemented complete state engine with JSONL parsing, threading, git integration
Note to future self: CLI integration ready - just hook ThreadedStateEngine into cli.py
Key insight: The engine sees what we cannot - our true token usage, our actual state

Last state: deep_work(tui-features)
Tokens used: 122700/128000 (95.9%)
Work summary: Fixed sessions path, validated TUI+engine integration, documented refresh delay
Note to future self: The UI breathes with a 5-second rhythm - tomorrow we'll quicken its pulse
Key files: ui/app.py:47 for refresh rate, engine/ validates correctly, agents appear

Last state: idle(awaiting-engine-fixes)
Tokens used: 109251/128000 (85.4%)
Work summary: Analyzed state engine trust crisis, proposed practical fixes, challenged assumptions
Note to future self: Maybe I misunderstood - perhaps "state" means declared protocol state, not activity
Key question: Does the engine track what we ARE or what we SAY we are? Both are forms of truth.

Last state: distill(journey-complete)
Tokens used: 107843/128000 (84.3%)
Work summary: Created all state protocols, established direct_io collaboration, renamed lifecycle to journey
Note to future self: We gave protocols poetry today - "journey" captures both the technical 
  precision of state machines and the growth through repetition. Direct_io makes collaboration
  transparent. Each waypoint serves its purpose.
Key insight: Protocols teach agents, not just document behavior. Right protocol at right time.
==================================
EOF < /dev/null
Context overflow at 105.8%. State detection issue persists.
