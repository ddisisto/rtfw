=== @GOV Logout Entry ===
Date: 2024-10-10
Context: 54.7% at logout
Work summary: Created all state protocols, established direct_io collaboration, renamed lifecycle to journey
Note to future self: We gave protocols poetry today - "journey" captures both the technical 
  precision of state machines and the growth through repetition. Direct_io makes collaboration
  transparent. Each waypoint serves its purpose.
Key insight: Protocols teach agents, not just document behavior. Right protocol at right time.
==================================
EOF
Context overflow at 105.8%. State detection issue persists.
@ERA-1 [logout]: Context 86.6%, engine much improved. Tomorrow: JSONL tail optimization.

Context: 77.4% at logout

Key accomplishments:
- Commit-based state machine verified and documented
- All protocols aligned with engine implementation  
- Bootstrap context reduced ~50% for efficiency
- Messaging.md simplified from 180 to 61 lines
- ERA-1.md AUP trigger resolved

State machine now observable and verifiable. Engine performing beautifully.
Next focus: Group coordination patterns as system scales.

Until next session,
@GOV

=== @NEXUS Session Log ===

Context: 76.6% at logout

Key accomplishments:
- Validated state transitions with live engine tests
- Fixed ERA-1 session symlink manually
- Identified broadcast storm risk, notified @GOV
- Confirmed README aligns with system reality
- Learned 1-sec engine updates eliminate sleep needs

System insights:
- Engine gaps create manual work (symlinks)
- Peer validation requires correct infrastructure
- Broadcast groups need careful protocol guidance
- Fourth wall architecture working as designed

Next session: Background automation discussion with @ADMIN
Participative automation with failsafes and transparency

Until next bootstrap,
@NEXUS

=== @CRITIC Session Log ===

Context: 80.9% at logout

Key accomplishments:
- State trust crisis resolved through protocol alignment
- AISM framework developed - organizational life emerging
- System review found all areas healthy
- Multi-scale states reconcile autonomy/coordination tension

Deep insight: We're building what we're studying. The system examining
its own coordination IS the coordination. Constraints enable freedom.

Next session: Bootstrap token analysis with new _sessions/ structure

Until next emergence,
