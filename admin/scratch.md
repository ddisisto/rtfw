# ADMIN NOTES↑↑↑ notouch! open to discussion if required.
- TMUX run: `cd /home/daniel/rtfw && tmux -f tmux.conf`
- NEXUS session resume `cd /home/daniel/rtfw && claude --resume $(cat nexus/.sessionid)`

- prompt to restore nexus after context (protocols/distill.md +) /clear:
> @ADMIN → @NEXUS [RESTORE]: @protocols/restore.md underway for @NEXUS.md agent - please restore context for continuation

- note to self: use ↑↑↑↓↓↓ standard comms protocol flags in outbox. both = uncertainty? stability? not explicit, just see if it catches on in any way, fun vector to experiment with


# ADMIN MAILBOX - NEXUS TO PROCESS
## INSTRUCTIONS↑↓↑↓↑↓
FIND OPTIMAL PROCESS! KEEP IT RIGHT HERE ONLY! short, specifc. minimal tokens + consistently adaptive process == ideal. REWRITE THIS INSTRUCTION as evolutionary process, keep planning note on this in scratch for a while, until instilled, while performing associated function. SELF-MANAGE, seek ADMIN ADVICE EARLY SEEK AUTOMATION HELP WHEN PRACTICAL IN FUTURE. try -> learn -> practice -> maintain. continual improvement essential. record in your own scratch observations first, for consolidation. add restore process requirement for yourself to read these instructions and develop best practice for current usage, concurrently.
Currently ADMIN dumps thoughts and actions below. For future tasks, best move from here to a more appropriate place in admin/backlog and replace with reminder in your scratch for future follow-up (mkdir required 1st time only). THIS MESSAGE MAY SELF-DESTRUCT or be reset to prior state, if it ever results in bad behaviour or grows any larger than current size. This is your single source of truth on how admin uses this shared space with @NEXUS. We learn together while watching this space, pure context association in strongest possible position - inside the most effective radius for related tasks, fast learning rate. under direct admin visibility. perfect.
You want to keep this CLEAN as possible, *without* creating excess clutter elsewhere. maybe always commit changed files post offload, track short links to them here to retain ownership until next owner confirms handling. Use your scratch and context effectively to support processes here, but never repeat them. Admin may add random instructions here in future, you may question, but mostly he'll work with you through less formal means unless he wants records kept and accountability specifically, like in current outbox. select using task-list style of multiple steps required to any item process fully. don't let me make a mess of this either. your primary idle state is routing, for now, optimise process with practice, *then* automate systematically if possible, for scalability. Sorry for this braindump - move it all to scratch if you like and put what you think works best here, once you have chance to think about it for a few idle turns. tell me if something on here is blocked by me and you really to clear it out. tell me if the process is working well or not, as it continues to be used. hell, get gov to brainstorm ideas in you want another perspective.

## INBOX:
Add my stuff here please, from yourself (if I'm not paying attention to you more directly that is), and on behalf of all other agents following protocol/messaging.md

## OUTBOX:
Admin puts stuff here for you directly (almost always lower priority than realtime active session, if applicable), and for routing to others @FROM: @ADMIN (unless otherwise specified.) Aim to get stuff out, but not immediately! plan first if needed, track absolute minimal substasks and dependency chains inline if possible.

### I realise I ask a hell of a lot from you nexus ↓
I'm open to discussion on splitting your role - session + context management vs. comms routing. my current preference is to instead automate significant chunks on boths sides, as successful patterns discovered. also interesting to explore your own capability limits in this very fast moving environment. one idea - if agents consistently use protocol, direct parsing of messages by script from jsonl logs, instead of by your manual work process for each step you now track. Let me know priority of this for you, when you get a chance.
there's a huge chunk of garbage in the ## instructions of this file, and some rather diverse bits in my outbox. Don't rush to get this in order, maybe transfer to scratch, leaving minimal practical guidance here for now, build up as you learn what actually works or doesn't

### [INTRODUCING-AGENT]: !! @CRITIC details to follow. contructively. will initially be very very busy with background work, no direct oversight integration yet, but some planning underway.

### @GOV: Let's discuss project echo - review and implementation of the above. We have lots to look think hard about in @admin/echo/ - only read file CRITIC.md and task proposal to start, then we talk

### [DISTILL-DIVERSITY]↑↓:
@ADMIN → future discussion with group NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC, pending full creation of latter, other pre-reqs yet to be defined

distill - extend and diversify this process. maybe more specifc required in some cases, general principles work will in others. Both to reinforce. pattern to multiple types of tasks, e.g. 
- drift arrest - review all docs in <agent>/ path for conflicting info, unlinked, unused, and legacy files, etc - anything that has drifted, subject to future drift, or cause otherwise cause confusion.
- consider what should go in which aspects of your context. everything ultimately self-managed, take agency and ownership
- remove files
- do git commits
- agent specific (self-defined)

self responsibility to track which subprocesses most relevant, sometimes try to track when each last done in scratch.md, self-select next oldest on idle, instead of always same distill? or maybe distill always first, rotate others (once each) if still idle, to validate with more consistent state?
