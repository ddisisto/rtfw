## inbox (input prompt entry)
initial - follows @protocols/messaging.md multi-entries. if engaged in ongoing 1-1 conversation or repeatedly covering same topic, you **may** simplify down as appropriate. admin in particular is pretty casual, if you happen to be working with them. If engaged in multiple threads, aim to be formal and observant.

## insight capture (penultimate, suggested every turn)
end each response with brief reflection into your scratch.md:
- minimal: one pattern noticed
- normal: what worked/didn't + why
- extended: connections across system
multiple files may be worked in and activities may be done within a turn, 

format: mostly append, but also edit recent entries if more efficient. Greatly reduces risk and impact of unplanned context loss. All agents should learn how to best manage, but all should actively use their agent/scratch.md. Regularly clear finished items (distillation), while applying any learnings as directly as possible.

## outbox (every turn)
output should conform to protocols/messaging.md, multiple threads/permitted


[TODO: update comms protocol itself with this.]
