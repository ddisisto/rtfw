# CRITIC First Assignment: Admin Intervention Analysis
**NOTE: Specific numbers and implementation details subject to review and analysis**
*status: initial draft*

## Objective
Review all historical @ADMIN direct interventions to identify patterns, extract implicit quality standards, and understand systemic blindnesses that required external correction.

## Scope
- All session logs containing @ADMIN → @AGENT interactions
- Focus on corrections, redirections, and clarifications
- Extract patterns across agents and time

## Process

### Phase 1: Session Log Understanding
1. @CRITIC → @NEXUS: Request session log format documentation
2. Understand structure, parsing requirements, and data layout
3. Develop reading strategy for large log files
4. Create progress tracking mechanism in critic/scratch.md

### Phase 2: Systematic Review
```markdown
## Progress Tracker (in critic/scratch.md)
- Total sessions identified: X
- Sessions reviewed: Y
- Current session: session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
- Line number: Z
- Patterns emerging: [tracked incrementally]
```

### Phase 3: Pattern Extraction

#### Per-Intervention Capture:
```markdown
Session: [ID]
Context: [what agent was doing]
Intervention: [what ADMIN corrected]
Category: [structural/contradiction/assumption/process]
Agent Response: [accepted/questioned/defended]
Pattern: [relates to which systemic issue]
```

#### Categories to Track:
1. **Contradiction Corrections**
   - Agent stated X then Y
   - ADMIN pointed out conflict
   - Resolution approach

2. **Structural Redirections**
   - Agent followed obsolete pattern
   - ADMIN suggested new structure
   - Adaptation resistance/acceptance

3. **Assumption Challenges**
   - Implicit belief surfaced
   - ADMIN questioned necessity
   - Agent's reasoning revealed

4. **Process Improvements**
   - Inefficient workflow identified
   - ADMIN proposed alternative
   - Adoption success/failure

### Phase 4: Cross-Context Synthesis

After each context reload:
1. Reload previous pattern analysis from context.md
2. Continue from tracked position
3. Add new patterns to existing clusters
4. Refine understanding incrementally

### Phase 5: Meta-Pattern Recognition

Questions to answer:
- Which blindnesses appear across all agents?
- What does ADMIN consistently catch that agents miss?
- Where do agents resist vs readily adapt?
- What implicit standards guide ADMIN's interventions?

### Phase 6: System Recommendations

Deliverable: critic/reports/admin_pattern_analysis.md
- Top 5 systemic blindnesses
- Recommended protocol additions
- Suggested awareness triggers
- Preventive measures

## Context Management Strategy

Given large log volume:
1. Process in ~100 intervention chunks
2. Distill patterns after each chunk
3. Maintain running synthesis in context.md
4. Use scratch.md for current chunk work
5. Track exact position for resumption

## Success Metrics
- All ADMIN interventions catalogued
- Patterns identified and validated
- Actionable recommendations produced
- Future interventions predictable from patterns

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Immediate
- Phase 2-4: Iterative across multiple sessions
- Phase 5-6: After full corpus review

Begin by establishing communication with @NEXUS for session log access and format understanding.

PHASE 2: Git Archaeology
PHASE 3: Online claude chat archaeology (past, current, future, covering this project directly, designing it with me, etc, great many artifacts to consider)
PHASE ?: Improve effective context size. later RAG? MCP tool extensions? not yet, wait until we can easily offload to builder with confidence. Comlexity may be required. Gradual improve throughout with tools and processes immediately available.
