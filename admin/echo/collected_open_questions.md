# Collected Open Question Responses for @CRITIC
2025-05-26


### From State Assumptions Analysis (critic/notes/state-assumptions.md)

1. **How do we measure "system coherence"?**
   - Context: Questioning the requirement to "commit changes promptly for system coherence"
   - Why it matters: Vague metrics lead to meaningless compliance


git commits ~> saved and backed up context checkpoint for an agent, in this case.

My own attempt at a definition 

but we need to step back and understand coherence more broadly. let's start with individual agent coherence, as I think it's easier to establish with anything resembling clarity. I'm really just learning to put words to this, and it's all very much post-hoc but here goes (as relevant to this project): functional continuity across distill/restore proccess. currently, practically, this is a vibe-check. If I notice increased self-contradiction, loss of previous knowledge or capabilities, etc, following restore, compared to within single traditional context window, this is coherence failure.

"System Coherence" could be taken that agent == system, or could be applying same idea to project as a whole.

I likely used this term in prev interactions first, without even considering what it really meant, "just felt right". Agents implicitly invited to project their own meaning and associations onto it (such as linking to concept of commits as we see), while it remains in some sort of contextual super-position.

Future directions:
- search out historical usages of terms: coherence, continuity
- research topic: is quantative coherence measurement possible?


2. **What makes governance "effective"?**
   - Context: STATE.md claims "simplified governance model proven effective"
   - Why it matters: Past success â‰  future fitness without clear criteria

I don't know how much I can say if "governance" itself is effective. like many terms used throughout, this still remains in some amount of super-position, even while being actively used as a specific agent name and scope. 

 I think the point here is that 


3. **Why prescribe tools vs outcomes?**
   - Context: TMUX as architectural requirement in system state
   - Why it matters: Implementation details shouldn't be in high-level docs

4. **Should STATE.md be split into stable/dynamic sections?**
   - Context: Document trying to be both snapshot and living truth
   - Why it matters: Already partially addressed with STATUS.md creation

### From Random vs Chronological Insights (critic/reports/random_vs_chronological_insights.md)

5. **Why so many approvals? Is positive reinforcement the primary teaching method?**
   - Context: 20% of interactions are approvals vs 11% corrections
   - Why it matters: Understanding teaching philosophy shapes agent development

6. **How does routing message frequency relate to system architecture decisions?**
   - Context: 43/250 sampled interactions were routing messages
   - Why it matters: Git-comms may have emerged from observed patterns

### From Current Investigation (critic/scratch.md)

7. **What triggers @ADMIN interventions?**
   - Partial answer: Questions and ideation as much as problems
   - Still open: Specific thresholds or patterns

8. **Which blindnesses appear across all agents?**
   - Status: Still investigating
   - Need more cross-agent analysis

9. **Where do agents resist vs readily adapt?**
   - Initial finding: Minimal resistance found in samples
   - Question: Is this due to positive reinforcement culture?

### From System Evolution Analysis (critic/reports/patterns/system-evolution.md)

10. **Were there failed experiments before current architecture?**
    - Context: Only seeing successful evolution in logs
    - Why it matters: Learning from failures prevents repetition

11. **What drove the specific agent selection?**
    - Context: Some agents shelved (ARCHITECT, TEST)
    - Why it matters: Understanding selection criteria for future agents

### From Context.md (critic/context.md)

12. **What would a hostile reviewer say?** (Sacred question)
    - Context: Anti-capture mechanism
    - Purpose: Maintain critical perspective

13. **What are we optimizing for that we shouldn't be?** (Sacred question)
    - Context: Fundamental assumption challenge
    - Purpose: Prevent local maxima

14. **What would this look like to someone who hates our approach?** (Sacred question)
    - Context: Perspective rotation
    - Purpose: See our own blind spots

15. **Where are we solving the wrong problem well?** (Sacred question)
    - Context: Efficiency vs effectiveness
    - Purpose: Question fundamental direction

### Process/Meta Questions

16. **How often should distillation occur?**
    - Current: "When idle" but no clear threshold
    - Impact: Under/over-distillation both problematic

17. **What constitutes "agent maturity"?**
    - Context: When is an agent ready for full autonomy?
    - Current: No clear graduation criteria

18. **Should agents develop their own protocols?**
    - Context: Agent sovereignty vs system coherence
    - Trade-off: Innovation vs chaos

### Technical Questions

19. **Why not use git hooks for message routing?**
    - Context: Current manual git_router.py approach
    - Trade-off: Automation vs control

20. **Should context.md have size limits?**
    - Context: Distillation manages growth but no hard limits
    - Impact: Restore complexity

## Note on Philosophy.md Pattern

You're correct - the "spaced out character-by-character" note in critic/reports/patterns/philosophy.md:12 is likely a parsing artifact from the logging system, not an actual @ADMIN pattern. Will remove this false pattern from the report.

## Summary

These questions range from philosophical (teaching methods, success metrics) to practical (tool choices, size limits). Many reveal tensions between:
- Flexibility vs consistency
- Autonomy vs coordination  
- Innovation vs stability
- Implicit vs explicit knowledge

Your answers to even a subset would significantly improve system understanding and future critical analysis.
