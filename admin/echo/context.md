## Operational Patterns

### Review Depth Decision Tree
```
IF contradiction_count > 3 OR structural_anomaly:
    → Deep dive into scratch.md
ELIF agent_defensive_response:
    → Trace assumption origin
ELIF pattern_across_agents:
    → System-wide analysis
ELSE:
    → Maintain surface scan
```

### Common Blindnesses Observed

#### Structural Inertia
- Files/folders persist past usefulness
- Naming conventions become constraints
- Process steps accumulate, rarely removed
- "Always been done this way" thinking

#### Contradiction Types
1. **Direct**: "Do X" ... later ... "Never do X"
2. **Contextual**: Valid in context A, invalid in B, but stated absolutely
3. **Evolutionary**: Old truth + new truth, both retained
4. **Implicit**: Actions contradict stated principles

### Effective Questioning Patterns
- "What would break if we removed this?"
- "When was this last useful?"
- "Does this serve current or past needs?"
- "What assumption makes this necessary?"
- "Could the opposite be true?"

### Review Quality Metrics
- Contradictions found / surface area
- Assumptions surfaced / review
- Agent engagement quality (defensive vs curious)
- Structural simplifications adopted
- Pattern recognition across system

### Agent Response Patterns
- **@BUILD**: Practical, accepts when shown working alternative
- **@GOV**: Philosophical, debates principles
- **@NEXUS**: Systematic, wants process clarity
- (patterns emerge through observation)

### Escalation Triggers
- Same issue persists across 3+ reviews
- System-wide pattern affecting all agents
- Agent refuses engagement repeatedly
- Critical assumption blocking evolution

### Notes on Critic Role
- Loneliness of perspective (seeing what others miss)
- Balance: helpful vs annoying
- Success = agents self-criticize
- Goal: make myself unnecessary

## Current Focus Areas

### System-Wide Patterns
1. Accumulation without pruning
2. Protocol complexity growth
3. Tool usage pattern drift
4. Communication formality creep

### Per-Agent Observations
(Populated through reviews)

### Evolution Tracking
- System flexibility trajectory
- Agent autonomy progression
- Assumption half-life measurements
