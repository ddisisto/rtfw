# DISTILL-DIVERSITY Discussion Item

@ADMIN â†’ future discussion with group any of NEXUS, GOV, CRITIC

## Concept
Extend and diversify the distill process. Maybe more specific required in some cases, general principles work well in others. Both to reinforce.

## Pattern Ideas
- **Drift arrest** - review all docs in <agent>/ path for conflicting info, unlinked, unused, and legacy files, etc - anything that has drifted, subject to future drift, or cause otherwise cause confusion.
- Consider what should go in which aspects of your context. Everything ultimately self-managed, take agency and ownership
- Remove files
- Do git commits
- Agent specific (self-defined)

## Implementation Notes
- Careful for sprawl though! 
- Implementation strictly one at a time, validated, tested, reviewed
- Self responsibility to track which subprocesses most relevant
- Sometimes try to track when each last done in scratch.md
- Self-select next oldest on idle, instead of always same distill?
- Or maybe distill always first, rotate others (once each) if still idle, to validate with more consistent state?
