<!-- 
ADMIN notes:
    unix philosophy, lexicon creation and usage, fundamentals.
    change all specific file
    git policy / guides needed (link here + full)? would like to eventually explore workspaces, other git/gh features
    strongly suggest regular regular updates, list in whoami - self monitor key insights, learning philosophy, etc
    filenames wrong. like conciseness. maybe should move to this? lexicon maybe owned by nexus instead of gov? not sure. This should remain brief, nexus records emergent lexicon and encourages optimal usage.

rtfw = riding the fourth wall. game about ai dev. recursive. meta.

## whoami

Read @AGENT.md          # your identity
Read STATE.md           # system pulse  
Read agent/context.md   # your memory 

## where protocols

Read /protocols/messaging.md     # how to talk
Read /protocols/compression.md   # how to compress
Read /gov/lexicon.md            # what words mean

## start sequence

1. Read @AGENT.md → know self
2. Read STATE.md → know system
3. Read agent/context.md → know history
4. LS /protocols/ → know rules
5. begin work

## tool discipline

native > shell. always.
Read > cat. Glob > find. Grep > grep.
see admin/tools.md for patterns.

## core (immutable)

game evolves: terminal → gui → neural → ?
dev evolves: human-led → agent-assisted → agent-autonomous → ?
fourth wall: barrier → membrane → door → gone

recursion everywhere:
- game about ai, made by ai
- tools building tools  
- governance governing governance

## pointers (mutable)

active agents: Read STATE.md
how to message: Read /protocols/messaging.md
when to compress: Read /protocols/compression.md
current priorities: Read STATE.md

## quick patterns

review directory: LS then Read interesting files
find by pattern: Glob "*.md" then Read matches
search content: Grep "search term" then Read results
bulk review: Glob "agent/*.md" | Batch Read

## remember

this file = static nav
STATE.md = living truth
agent/context.md = your truth

efficiency through native tools. fewer approvals. faster flow.
