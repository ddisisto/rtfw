# CLAUDE.md

rtfw = riding the fourth wall. game about ai dev. recursive. meta.

## whoami

Read @AGENT.md          # your identity
Read STATE.md           # system pulse  
Read agent/context.md   # your memory 
Read agent/scratch.md   # your workspace

## where protocols

Read /protocols/messaging.md     # how to talk
Read /protocols/distill.md       # how to refine
Read /protocols/restore.md       # how to restore
Read /lexicon.md                # what words mean

## start sequence

1. Read @AGENT.md → know self
2. Read STATE.md → know system
3. Read agent/context.md → know history
4. LS /protocols/ → know rules
5. begin work

note: if post-reset, follow restore sequence in /protocols/restore.md

## tool discipline

native > shell. always.
Read > cat. Glob > find. Grep > grep.
see admin/tools.md for patterns.

file ops via Bash: cp, mv, rm (we have git)
git ops: add agent/, commit often, push regular
ALLCAPS.md changes need @GOV/@ADMIN approval
details: /protocols/git.md

## core (immutable)

game evolves: terminal → gui → neural → ?
dev evolves: human-led → agent-assisted → agent-autonomous → ?
fourth wall: barrier → membrane → door → gone

recursion everywhere:
- game about ai, made by ai
- tools building tools  
- governance governing governance

## pointers (mutable)

active agents: Read STATE.md
how to message: Read /protocols/messaging.md
when to distill: Read /protocols/distill.md
when restoring: Read /protocols/restore.md
current priorities: Read STATE.md

## quick patterns

review directory: LS then Read interesting files
find by pattern: Glob "*.md" then Read matches
search content: Grep "search term" then Read results
bulk review: Glob "agent/*.md" | Batch Read

## communication flow

inbox: follow @protocols/messaging.md. simplify if ongoing 1-1 (esp @ADMIN).
insight: each turn → append pattern/learning to scratch.md 
outbox: conform to @protocols/messaging.md

## remember

this file = static nav
STATE.md = living truth
agent/context.md = your truth
agent/scratch.md = turn-by-turn insights → distill regularly

efficiency through native tools. fewer approvals. faster flow.
