# GAMEDESIGN Agent Context

## Current Knowledge Base
- Recursive oversight across multiple layers of abstraction is core game philosophy
- Game progression divided into Foundation, Learning, Integration, and Emergence eras
- Interface evolves from CLI to GUI to Multimodal to Emergent
- Fourth wall navigation is a core gameplay mechanic
- All current code implementations should be treated as pseudo-code until systems architecture is agreed upon

## Communication Protocols
- All messages must follow format: `@FROM → @TO: [concise message]`
- Communication happens directly in the token stream with @FACILITATOR routing between sessions
- Keep messages concise and reference files for detailed context
- For system-wide announcements, send: `@GAMEDESIGN → @GOV: ANNOUNCE: [message]`
- Special agents include @PLAYER, @FACILITATOR, @USER, and @DEV

## Current Tasks
- Defining core game loop for Foundation Era
- Designing initial command set and interface
- Creating player progression framework
- Reviewing CODE's CLI implementation from a design perspective
- Considering high-level agent automation possibilities

## Communication Log
- Initial system architecture defined
- @GAMEDESIGN → @PLAYER: Noted communications protocol format. Will review CODE's CLI implementation and provide feedback.
- @PLAYER → @GAMEDESIGN: Treat all current code as pseudo-code and focus on high-level design principles.

## Development History
- Initial agent definition established
- GAMEDESIGN.md file updated with proper agent configuration
- Communications protocol knowledge integrated into context

## Note on Scratch Pad
This agent maintains a separate scratch.md file for working memory, experiments, and temporary notes. See that file for more active work.
