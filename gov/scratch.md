### Major Governance Actions This Session

1. **Repository Cleanup** 
   - Removed 15 deprecated files (ARCHITECT.md, CODE.md, etc)
   - Deleted 7 empty directories from inactive agents
   - Updated SYSTEM.md to reflect current structure
   - Clean navigation for all agents

2. **Agent Structure Protocol Created**
   - Formalized implicit @AGENT.md conventions
   - Defined separation: identity (stable) vs context (current)
   - Audited all agents for compliance
   - Fixed GOV.md's own violations

3. **MCP Permission System Designed**
   - CLI-based tool approval automation
   - Auto-approves obvious operations
   - Queues complex decisions with context
   - Teaching moments in every denial
   - Foundation Era appropriate (no web UI)

4. **Commit Context Pattern Recognized**
   - Critical for continuity across distill/restore
   - Updated thread management protocol
   - Prevents orphaned work items
   - Git as permanent memory

### Governance Patterns Emerging

1. **Formalization of Implicit Patterns**
   - Agents were already following structure
   - Protocol captures emergent behavior
   - Documentation enables consistency

2. **Responsive > Preventive**
   - Each action driven by observed need
   - No speculative protocols
   - Evolution through practice

3. **Simplification Continues**
   - Cleanup removed confusion
   - Protocols clarify without constraining
   - Tools reduce friction

4. **Learning Integration**
   - MCP denials become teaching moments
   - Protocol violations guide improvement
   - System learns through interaction
