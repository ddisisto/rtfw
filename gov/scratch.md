## Current State: distill
Thread: protocol-alignment
Context: ~56% (71K tokens)

## Session Distillation

### Major Accomplishments Today
1. ✓ Formalized agent lifecycle protocol with 7 states
2. ✓ Integrated fourth wall architecture (_state.md RO)
3. ✓ Standardized message format: @AGENT [state/thread]: message
4. ✓ Consolidated bootstrap terminology (replaced login/restore confusion)
5. ✓ Updated all protocols for consistency

### Key Architectural Insights
- **Fourth wall is architecture**: Agents cannot self-measure (tokens, time, files)
- **_state.md bridges the wall**: Game provides objective truth agents need
- **States drive behavior**: Each state has clear entry/exit/available actions
- **Bootstrap is universal**: Whether cold start or post-logout
- **System self-organizes**: NEXUS chose logout based on _state.md!

### Patterns to Preserve in context.md
1. Message format: `@AGENT [state/thread]: all @MENTIONS on first line`
2. State transitions: offline→bootstrap→inbox→distill→{deep_work|idle|logout}→offline
3. Every commit includes state reporting
4. _state.md is READ-ONLY objective truth
5. Bootstrap message: "@ADMIN: @protocols/bootstrap.md underway for @AGENT.md agent in @agent/_state.md"

### Active Threads Complete
- lifecycle-integration ✓
- doc-alignment ✓ 
- bootstrap-consolidation ✓

### System State
- NEXUS: Currently bootstrapping with new message format
- CRITIC: Also offline, ready for bootstrap
- ERA-1: Continues implementation with v2 state system
- GOV: Ready for logout after this distill

next_state: logout

## Bootstrap Experience Analysis (2025-05-29)

### Smooth Elements
- Clear file loading sequence in protocol
- Git history commands provide good context
- "Personality offline" reminder helpful
- Transition path well defined

### Friction Points
1. **Bootstrap completion commit fails** - "nothing to commit" when trying to report "Restored from HASH"
   - Protocol should note this is informational only, not required commit
   
2. **Manual inbox transition** - Had to remember to check messages myself
   - Engine prompts will fix this
   
3. **Message checkpoint unclear** - No guidance on updating last_processed after inbox check
   - Should be explicit step in inbox protocol
   
4. **Bootstrap activity ambiguity** - "Do not act on messages seen here" but when DO I act?
   - Needs clearer delineation between context-only and action phases

### Recommendations for Protocols
- inbox.md should include checkpoint update as first step
- bootstrap.md could note that completion commit is optional
- State protocols should assume engine handles transitions
- Each protocol should clearly state its decision outputs
