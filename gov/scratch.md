### Key Insight: Agent Differentiation Model

Traditional orgs differentiate by capability (frontend vs backend dev).
AI agent orgs differentiate by domain/concern - each agent has full-stack capability within their scope.

Benefits:
- No context handoff loss
- Domain expertise stays with implementation  
- Faster iteration cycles
- Natural ownership boundaries

Implications:
- BUILD role redundant as currently defined
- Agents as "domain owners" not "skill specialists"
- Focus: "what do you own?" not "what can you do?"

### Governance Patterns Emerging

1. **Responsive > Proactive**: BUILD deprecation came from ADMIN observation during actual use, not from scheduled review. This validates our responsive governance model.

2. **Simplification in Practice**: Protocol consolidation (git-comms â†’ messaging.md) shows continuous refinement working. Fewer, clearer protocols.

3. **Evolution Through Use**: System assumptions get tested through practice. BUILD's underuse revealed design flaw - capability-based rather than domain-based differentiation.

4. **Trust Git History**: No need for archived/ directories. Git maintains full history. Cleaner repo, same preservation.

### GOV.md Review Notes

Current doc mostly accurate but needs updates:
- Remove references to deprecated protocols (comms_protocol.md)
- Update protocol list to reflect /protocols/ migration
- Consider adding "System Evolution" as core function
- Bootstrap protocol could be simplified

### System Learning
- Domain ownership model discovered through BUILD failure
- Protocol migration to /protocols/ successful
- Three-doc structure (CLAUDE/SYSTEM/STATUS) proving clearer than monolithic STATE.md
