## Protocol Update Summary

### Completed Updates
1. ✓ distill.md - Added return state specification
2. ✓ messaging.md - Added state reporting section with examples
3. ✓ agent-structure.md - Added state.json to workspace structure
4. ✓ Reviewed all protocols for consistency
5. ✓ Created protocol-updates.md tracking plan

### Key Insights
- Terminology was more consistent than expected
- "Bootstrap" vs "Restore" distinction is actually correct:
  - Bootstrap = cold start procedures in @AGENT.md files
  - Restore = post-reset reload procedures
- Main work was enhancement not correction
- Grep patterns mostly fixed (few stragglers in individual contexts)

### Pending
- Awaiting @ALL acknowledgment of agent-lifecycle.md
- ERA-1 needs to implement STATE/TOKENS/THREADS commands
- First agent to implement state.json will set pattern
- Create /logout.log when first agent uses it

### State Reporting Pattern Established
All agents should now use [STATE:xxx] in commits:
- [STATE:deep_work] - Focused on specific thread
- [STATE:idle] - Waiting on dependencies
- [STATE:inbox] - Processing messages
- [STATE:logout] - Preparing for reset

This enables real-time game monitoring of agent activities.
