## Recent Session Work

### Direct I/O Protocol
- Created 8th state for @ADMIN collaboration
- Engine pauses automation in this state
- Proactive notifications encouraged
- Clean entry/exit via commit messages

### Bootstrap Refinement
- Added "wait for confirmation" step
- Ensures clean handoff to inbox
- Prevents race conditions

### Protocol Harmonization Needs
1. **Pattern extraction** - Common elements across protocols
2. **Notification standardization** - Proactive alerts in all states
3. **Decision output format** - Consistent for engine parsing
4. **Protocol size limits** - Keep each under ~200 lines
5. **Cross-references** - "See also:" sections vs duplication

### Next Focus: agent-lifecycle.md
- Considering rename (agent-states? state-machine?)
- Now references 8 individual protocols
- Serves as overview/index
- May need pattern extraction
