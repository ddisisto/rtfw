## Documentation Alignment Complete

### Changes Made
1. ✓ Updated agent-lifecycle.md examples to new format
2. ✓ Updated lifecycle-integration.md commit examples (7 instances)
3. ✓ Fixed thread-management.md example
4. ✓ Verified all @AGENT.md files are clean
5. ✓ Confirmed no old [STATE:xxx] format in context/scratch files

### Format Now Consistent
- Old: `@AGENT: [STATE:xxx] message`
- New: `@AGENT [state/thread]: message with all @MENTIONS`

### Key Pattern Clarified
The grep pattern `grep -v '^[a-f0-9]* @AGENT:'` is CORRECT - it filters out agent's own commits, and the colon is part of the author format, not the state format.

### Ready for Commit
All documentation now aligned with new message format.
