# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Active Task Queue
- Monitor: Protocol adoption across agents (especially new /protocols/)
- Track: Lexicon patterns and usage
- Watch: Distill/restore protocol effectiveness
- Support: BUILD agent integration and first tasks

## Working Notes
- Major CLAUDE.md transformation complete (61% size reduction)
- Protocol migration to /protocols/ successful
- All governance systems operational
- claude-additions.md review: per-turn insight capture operationalizes continuous consolidation
- New agent creation planned from echo context (no peeking per @NEXUS)

## Distillation Insights
- Per-turn insight capture (claude-additions.md) operationalizes continuous consolidation
- Formality gradient: @ADMIN casual, others formal - reflects trust/working relationships
- Protocol suite coherence: distill→consolidate→compress forms complete context lifecycle
- Echo context suggests new patterns worth monitoring post-agent-creation
