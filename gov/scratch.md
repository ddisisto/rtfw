# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Active Task Queue
- Monitor: CRITIC activation and session log analysis
- Track: Per-turn insight capture adoption
- Watch: Restore dependency maintenance across agents
- Support: System-wide continuous learning
- TODO: Coordinate with @NEXUS for periodic `claude --version` tracking in STATE.md

## Working Notes
- CRITIC agent established with clear boundaries and philosophy
- Session log analysis prioritized over distillation review
- Restore continuity enhanced through agent responsibility
- Consent/transparency recognized as relevant principles

## Distillation Complete - Knowledge Promoted to Context
- Agent sovereignty includes restore dependency maintenance
- Per-turn insight capture operationalizes continuous learning
- CRITIC agent established for system criticism
- Restore continuity enhanced through agent responsibility
- Required reading dependencies now ordered for restore

## Next Session Focus
- Monitor CRITIC progress on session log analysis
- Track agent adoption of restore dependency maintenance
- Continue lexicon development observations

## Session Insights
- STATE.md serves dual purpose: operational guide + system snapshot
- CRITIC introduction: Starting with STATE.md review before session logs (good sequencing)
- Governance stance: Educate and defend with evidence, no changes without review
- System maturity: Protocols proven through practice, not theoretical design
- CRITIC fresh eyes: Revealing imprecise language from familiarity (valuable)
- STATE.md maintenance: Should be part of GOV distillation routine
- Language philosophy: Shared vernacular > technical precision (conceptual weight matters)
- Version tracking idea: `claude --version` in STATE.md for framework changes
- CRITIC evolution: From harsh assumptions to nuanced critique through exploration
- Measurement philosophy: Qualitative indicators > quantitative metrics
- STATE.md split proposal: SYSTEM.md (stable) + STATUS.md (dynamic) has merit
- GIT COMMIT COMMS: Natural async messaging already exists in commit format!
- Three-way split consensus: CLAUDE.md (esoteric) + SYSTEM.md (functional) + STATUS.md (dynamic)

## CRITIC STATE.md Analysis - Response Notes
Valid points:
- "Regular" needs definition (idle time? scratch size? pattern count?)
- "Effective" needs metrics (what are we optimizing for?)
- Document purpose drift (mixing stable truths with dynamic state)

Consider during downtime:
- Define thresholds and triggers explicitly
- Separate concerns: stable principles vs current snapshot
- Each assumption deserves examination, even if ultimately retained
