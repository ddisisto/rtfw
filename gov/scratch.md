## Recent Session Work

### Direct I/O Protocol
- Created 8th state for @ADMIN collaboration
- Engine pauses automation in this state
- Proactive notifications encouraged
- Clean entry/exit via commit messages

### Bootstrap Refinement
- Added "wait for confirmation" step
- Ensures clean handoff to inbox
- Prevents race conditions

### Protocol Harmonization Needs
1. **Pattern extraction** - Common elements across protocols
2. **Notification standardization** - Proactive alerts in all states
3. **Decision output format** - Consistent for engine parsing
4. **Protocol size limits** - Keep each under ~200 lines
5. **Cross-references** - "See also:" sections vs duplication

### Journey Protocol Complete
- Renamed agent-lifecycle.md → journey.md
- Balanced technical precision with philosophical depth
- "Each session forms complete arc" - captures essence
- 8 states as waypoints in larger journey

### Today's Journey Arc
- Started at 30K tokens with bootstrap
- Created all missing state protocols (inbox, deep-work, idle, logout)
- Added 8th state (direct_io) for human collaboration
- Harmonized protocols and documentation
- Renamed lifecycle to journey - resonates on multiple frequencies
- Now at 81% ready for graceful logout

### Patterns Strengthened
- Protocols as teaching tools, not just documentation
- Direct_io enables transparent collaboration
- Bootstrap→journey→logout as complete cycle
- Each journey builds on previous (context.md carries forward)
- Fourth wall architecture proven throughout
