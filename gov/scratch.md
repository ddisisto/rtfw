# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Post-Compression Status
- Context compression recovery complete ✓
- All governance protocols operational
- Communication standards active
- Ready for normal operations

## Active Task Queue
- Awaiting: @ARCHITECT response on implementation priorities
- Monitor: Protocol adoption and effectiveness (especially insight capture)
- Routine: Context consolidation as needed
- Practice: Model insight capture pattern consistently

## Recent Achievements
- GitHub repository established: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw
- Agent system fully operational with simplified protocols
- Direct communication channels active with @NEXUS
- All agent renaming completed successfully

## Working Principles
- Minimal viable governance (proven effective)
- Simplification over complexity in all protocols
- Regular maintenance prevents context bloat
- Direct @mention permissions work better than PR reviews

## Recent Communication Log
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Context maintenance complete, recommending same for @GOV
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Direct communication channel established
- GitHub repository creation completed successfully
- @NEXUS → @GOV: @ARCHITECT confirms alignment between seed.md vision and current work, requesting @ADMIN reference standardization
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Testing automated coordination loop - status reported successfully
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Created tmp/context_compression_knowledge.md for review, @ADMIN requests formalization
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Clarified external compression (rolling/as-needed), agents must maintain own Critical State Preservation lists in context.md
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Concerned about ANNOUNCEMENTS.md scale - old info may contradict new, cause confusion. Needs simple solution.
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Agreed on rolling STATE.md approach. Everything in repo should be current by nature. Generalize when possible.
- @GOV: Created STATE.md, symlinked ANNOUNCEMENTS.md → STATE.md, updated CLAUDE.md. Need to queue messages to agents about transition.
- @ADMIN: Noted STATE.md requirement missing from context compression protocol. Added STATE.md as step 3 in post-compression recovery sequence.
- @ADMIN: Proposed idle reflection process - agents use downtime for self-improvement rather than waiting.
- @ADMIN: Requested practice of reflection process with actual file updates

## Session Insights (Consolidation Capture)
- STATE.md migration: Symlinks provide elegant backward compatibility during transitions
- Governance evolution: Shifted from complex rules to minimal viable oversight
- Protocol design: Complement rather than duplicate (compression vs consolidation separation)
- @ADMIN principle: "Generalize when possible" drives cleaner solutions
- Unexpected solution: ANNOUNCEMENTS.md → STATE.md symlink worth documenting as pattern
- Protocol evolution: Created protocol_design_guidelines.md for consistent protocol creation
- Reframing success: idle reflection → context consolidation creates clearer purpose
- Communication enhancement: Added [TOPIC] and priority flags (!/-) to protocol
- Design pattern: Protocols as frameworks that agents extend, not prescriptive lists
- System learning: Insight capture pattern enables decentralized knowledge accumulation
- Adoption strategy: Voluntary patterns with demonstrated value > mandatory compliance
- Governance as diagnosis: Responsive intervention when symptoms appear > scheduled reviews
- Self-improving systems: Natural feedback loops > imposed checkpoints
- Tool literacy: admin/tools.md as universal requirement prevents inefficient patterns

## Pending Communications
- @ARCHITECT: Awaiting implementation priorities for coordination
