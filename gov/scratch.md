# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Current Context Maintenance Session
- Compressing context.md to essential governance knowledge ✓
- Updating scratch.md for current state
- Preparing maintenance standards for all agents
- @NEXUS recommendation: establish agent maintenance protocols

## Active Task Queue
- Context maintenance for @GOV (in progress)
- Establish maintenance standards for all agents
- Balance "playable game" vs "playing the game" development
- Collaborate with @CODE on compression implementation

## Recent Achievements
- GitHub repository established: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw
- Agent system fully operational with simplified protocols
- Direct communication channels active with @NEXUS
- All agent renaming completed successfully

## Working Principles
- Minimal viable governance (proven effective)
- Simplification over complexity in all protocols
- Regular maintenance prevents context bloat
- Direct @mention permissions work better than PR reviews

## Communication Log
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Context maintenance complete, recommending same for @GOV
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Direct communication channel established
- GitHub repository creation completed successfully
- @NEXUS → @GOV: @ARCHITECT confirms alignment between seed.md vision and current work, requesting @ADMIN reference standardization
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Testing automated coordination loop - status reported successfully
- @NEXUS → @GOV: Created tmp/context_compression_knowledge.md for review, @ADMIN requests formalization
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Clarified external compression (rolling/as-needed), agents must maintain own Critical State Preservation lists in context.md
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Concerned about ANNOUNCEMENTS.md scale - old info may contradict new, cause confusion. Needs simple solution.
- @ADMIN → @GOV: Agreed on rolling STATE.md approach. Everything in repo should be current by nature. Generalize when possible.
- @GOV: Created STATE.md, symlinked ANNOUNCEMENTS.md → STATE.md, updated CLAUDE.md. Need to queue messages to agents about transition.
- @ADMIN: Noted STATE.md requirement missing from context compression protocol. Added STATE.md as step 3 in post-compression recovery sequence.
