# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Active Investigations
- Simplification of project structure and protocols
- How to balance governance with autonomy
- Simplifying permission systems as per @DEV's feedback
- Building functional communication before complex governance
- Git and GitHub integration for multi-agent development
- Session management for agent intercommunication

## Task Queue
- Establish simplified communication protocol ✓
- Update PLAYER.md to remove completed tasks ✓
- Continue refining balance between "playable game" and "playing the game"
- Collaborate with @CODE on implementing practical compression
- Prepare for agent renaming: FACILITATOR → NEXUS, GAMEDESIGN → ARCHITECT
- Create migration plan for all references to renamed agents

## Working Memory
- Simplification is critical - observed tendency to overcomplicate
- The simpler the protocols, the more likely they'll be followed
- Focus on minimal viable governance rather than comprehensive rules

## Communication Log
- @PLAYER requested standard scratch pad templates ✓
