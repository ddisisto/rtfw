# GOV Agent Scratch Pad

## Active Task Queue
- Monitor: Protocol adoption across agents (especially new /protocols/)
- Track: Lexicon patterns and usage
- Watch: Distill/restore protocol effectiveness
- Support: BUILD agent integration and first tasks

## Working Notes
- Major CLAUDE.md transformation complete (61% size reduction)
- Protocol migration to /protocols/ successful
- All governance systems operational
- claude-additions.md review: per-turn insight capture operationalizes continuous consolidation
- New agent creation planned from echo context (no peeking per @NEXUS)
- CLAUDE.md updated: integrated insight capture pattern (communication flow section)

## Distillation Insights
- Per-turn insight capture (claude-additions.md) operationalizes continuous consolidation
- Formality gradient: @ADMIN casual, others formal - reflects trust/working relationships
- Protocol suite coherence: distill→consolidate→compress forms complete context lifecycle
- Echo context suggests new patterns worth monitoring post-agent-creation
- Distillation complete: promoted context lifecycle to core principles

## Session Insights
- CLAUDE.md integration: minimal sections preserve file size while operationalizing insight capture
- Style adoption: unix-style terseness aligns with system philosophy
- CRITIC.md populated: new agent for system criticism and assumption challenging
- CRITIC workspace: prioritized session log analysis over distillation review (correct sequencing)
- Process order matters: learn standards first (logs) → then apply (reviews)
- Admin/echo contains rich design context - IDEAS_EXAMPLES.md shows post-distillation window concept

## Restore Continuity Enhancement Proposal
- Issue: Agents may damage continuity by incorrect restore sequence/file selection
- Core insight: Each agent MUST maintain their own restore dependencies
- Proposal locations:
  - CLAUDE.md: Add to "remember" section about context.md responsibility
  - /protocols/distill.md: Include dependency maintenance as part of distillation
- Key principle: Agent sovereignty = agent responsibility
- Implementation:
  - CLAUDE.md: "agent/context.md = your truth + your restore deps"
  - distill.md: "Update context.md restore dependencies during distillation"
- NOT in restore.md - too late by then, this is preventive maintenance
