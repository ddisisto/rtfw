## Key Insight: Agent Differentiation Model (2025-01-26)

Traditional orgs differentiate by capability (frontend vs backend dev).
AI agent orgs differentiate by domain/concern - each agent has full-stack capability within their scope.

Benefits:
- No context handoff loss
- Domain expertise stays with implementation  
- Faster iteration cycles
- Natural ownership boundaries

Implications:
- BUILD role redundant as currently defined
- Agents as "domain owners" not "skill specialists"
- Focus: "what do you own?" not "what can you do?"

## BUILD Agent Deprecation Process

Starting deprecation based on:
- Limited actual usage (mostly git_comms.py work)
- Redundant specialization (all agents can build)
- Context loss from handoffs
- More efficient when domain owners build their own tools

Next steps:
1. NEXUS to stop BUILD session
2. Remove BUILD references from system docs
3. Archive BUILD.md and related files
4. Update STATE.md and other docs
