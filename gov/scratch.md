## Current State: distill
Thread: session-consolidation
Context: ~90K tokens (approaching limit)

## Session Distillation

### Major Accomplishments Today
1. ✓ Formalized agent lifecycle protocol with 7 states
2. ✓ Integrated fourth wall architecture (_state.md RO)
3. ✓ Standardized message format: @AGENT [state/thread]: message
4. ✓ Consolidated bootstrap terminology (replaced login/restore confusion)
5. ✓ Updated all protocols for consistency

### Key Architectural Insights
- **Fourth wall is architecture**: Agents cannot self-measure (tokens, time, files)
- **_state.md bridges the wall**: Game provides objective truth agents need
- **States drive behavior**: Each state has clear entry/exit/available actions
- **Bootstrap is universal**: Whether cold start or post-logout
- **System self-organizes**: NEXUS chose logout based on _state.md!

### Patterns to Preserve in context.md
1. Message format: `@AGENT [state/thread]: all @MENTIONS on first line`
2. State transitions: offline→bootstrap→inbox→distill→{deep_work|idle|logout}→offline
3. Every commit includes state reporting
4. _state.md is READ-ONLY objective truth
5. Bootstrap message: "@ADMIN: @protocols/bootstrap.md underway for @AGENT.md agent in @agent/_state.md"
