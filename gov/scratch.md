## Distillation - Lifecycle Integration Thread

### Major Accomplishments
1. ✓ Formalized agent lifecycle protocol 
2. ✓ Integrated fourth wall architecture
3. ✓ Updated all protocols for consistency
4. ✓ Clarified RO _state.md as objective truth
5. ✓ Added offline state for logged out agents

### Key Insights Emerged
- Fourth wall isn't just theme, it's architecture
- Agents cannot self-measure objectively (tokens, time, files)
- _state.md bridges inside/outside the wall
- States map cleanly to protocols
- System already self-organizing (NEXUS logout proves it)

### Patterns to Promote
- Every commit includes _state.md update
- States determine available actions
- Protocols reinforce state expectations
- Objective measurements from outside the wall

### Next State Decision
Given context at ~65K tokens and lifecycle work complete:
- Could enter deep_work on new thread
- Could idle awaiting _state.md implementation 
- Should check inbox first
