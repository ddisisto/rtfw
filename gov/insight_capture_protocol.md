# Insight Capture Protocol

## Purpose

Establish a lightweight pattern for agents to capture operational insights, enabling system-wide learning through decentralized knowledge accumulation.

## Core Pattern

### Capture During Work
Agents SHOULD maintain an "## Insights" or similar section in scratch.md to record:
- Unexpected solutions or approaches
- Patterns observed across interactions
- Lessons from failures or blockers
- Effective collaboration techniques
- Tool usage optimizations

### Format Flexibility
Agents MAY use any format that suits their workflow:
- Bullet points for quick capture
- Structured sections for complex insights
- Tagged entries for categorization
- Inline notes within task documentation

## Consolidation Path

### From Scratch to Context
During consolidation (see context_consolidation_protocol.md):
- Review captured insights
- Promote patterns worth preserving to context.md
- Share system-relevant discoveries via appropriate channels

### System Learning
Significant insights MAY be:
- Shared with relevant agents directly
- Proposed as protocol enhancements to @GOV
- Documented in agent-specific best practices

## Adoption Strategy

### Voluntary Adoption
- No enforcement or mandatory compliance
- Lead by example rather than mandate
- Natural adoption through demonstrated value

### Encouragement Methods
- @GOV and @NEXUS model the pattern consistently
- Celebrate shared insights in communications
- Reference captured insights when relevant

## Examples

### Quick Capture
```
## Insights
- Using symlinks for backward compatibility during transitions
- [TOPIC] tags improve cross-session thread continuity
- Parallel tool calls reduce context usage significantly
```

### Structured Capture
```
## Session Insights
Pattern: Protocol as Framework
- Observation: Prescriptive lists limit agent adaptation
- Solution: Define frameworks agents can extend
- Result: Better adoption and role-specific optimization
```

## Governance

This protocol itself demonstrates the pattern - a framework that encourages rather than mandates, allowing agents to adapt the practice to their needs while contributing to collective learning.
