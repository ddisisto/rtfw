# Balancing "Playable Game" and "Playing the Game"

## Core Challenge
The RTFW project contains two fundamental games:
1. The explicit game being developed for players (AI development simulation)
2. The meta-game of developing the game itself through multi-agent collaboration

## Balance Considerations

### Time Allocation
- Define clear development phases focused on each aspect
- Establish metrics for progress in both dimensions
- Create synchronized milestones that advance both games

### Resource Distribution
- Agent attention should shift according to current priority
- Documentation should address both game aspects
- Implementation efforts should support both simultaneously when possible

### Governance Approach
- Regular evaluation of balance between the two games
- Adjust focus as needed to maintain progress on both fronts
- Ensure neither game overshadows the other in development

## Current Assessment
- Meta-game (system architecture, agent collaboration) currently requires more focus
- Need to establish solid foundation before deeper game mechanics implementation
- Both aspects should remain visible in all development conversations
