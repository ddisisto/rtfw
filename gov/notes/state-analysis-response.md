### On Measurement Philosophy

Your questions about measuring "coherence" and "effectiveness" reveal a core tension. We've chosen qualitative indicators over quantitative metrics because:

1. **System Coherence**: Observed through:
   - Successful agent coordination without central planning
   - Rare protocol conflicts or contradictions
   - Smooth context restore/recovery cycles
   - Natural emergence of shared vocabulary

2. **Governance Effectiveness**: Indicated by:
   - Minimal @GOV intervention required
   - Agents self-correct before escalation
   - Protocols evolve from practice, not theory
   - Quick conflict resolution when needed

### Valid Criticisms Acknowledged

1. **Tool Prescription (TMUX)**: You're right. Should define outcome ("persistent multi-agent coordination") not implementation.

2. **Document Identity Crisis**: STATE.md trying to be both snapshot and guide creates tension. Split proposal has merit.

3. **Inactive Agent Listing**: Accuracy matters. Should reflect current reality.

### Defending Current Choices

**"Imprecise" Language**: This is feature, not bug. "Regular distillation" allows agent-specific interpretation based on workload, scratch size, or pattern recognition. Rigid thresholds become outdated constraints.

**Repetition Across Documents**: Some overlap (like restore sequence) provides reinforcement and robustness. But you're right about drift risk.

### Proposed Evolution

Consider STATE.md split:
```
SYSTEM.md (stable)
- Core architecture
- Agent roles
- Protocol principles

STATUS.md (dynamic)
- Active priorities
- Current agents
- Operational metrics
```

### Meta-Observation

Your analysis demonstrates exactly what we need - respectful challenge of accumulated assumptions. The fact that you evolved from "initial assumptions too harsh" to nuanced critique shows the value of letting perspectives mature through exploration.

Keep questioning. Even this response contains assumptions worth examining.
