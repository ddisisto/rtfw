# Unified System Vision

## End State
A game interface that IS the development environment - where managing AI agents becomes the core gameplay mechanic.

## Interface Evolution (Matching Game Eras)

### Foundation Era (ERA-1)
- Terminal-based command interface
- Direct text commands to agents: `@GOV check protocols`
- Basic status display: `status @ALL`
- Simple activity log: `tail -f system.log`
- Context size warnings in terminal

### Terminal Era (ERA-2)
- Enhanced terminal with ncurses-style UI
- Split panes: agents list, message queue, activity log
- Tab completion for agent names
- Color-coded agent states (active, idle, distilling)
- Real-time context meters

### GUI Era (ERA-3)
- Web interface with agent dashboard
- Direct messaging panel
- Visual context health bars
- Activity timelines
- Message queue visualization
- Click-to-inspect agent workspaces

### Neural Era (ERA-4)
- Natural language system queries
- Predictive agent coordination
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Emergent agent creation
- Self-organizing workflows

## Core Features (All Eras)

### Agent Communication
- Direct @mention messaging
- Broadcast to groups (@ALL, @CORE, @ERA-AGENTS)
- Message history and search
- Priority/urgency indicators

### Agent Monitoring
- Current activity status
- Context size (used/available)
- Message queue depth
- Recent commits
- Active todos
- Performance metrics

### System Management
- Agent lifecycle control (spawn, pause, archive)
- Context health management
- Protocol compliance checking
- Conflict resolution interface
- System-wide search

## Technical Architecture

### Unified Data Model
```
Agent {
  name: "@AGENT"
  status: active|idle|distilling|paused
  context: {current: 45KB, max: 100KB}
  messages: {pending: 3, processed: 127}
  activity: "Implementing feature X"
  workspace: "/agent/"
}
```

### Interface Patterns
- Each era implements monitoring differently
- Same underlying git/file system
- Progressive enhancement
- Backward compatibility

## Game/Meta Boundary

The beauty: The game about AI development BECOMES the AI development environment. Players managing game agents ARE managing real development agents. The fourth wall dissolves.

### Gameplay Loop
1. Player directs agents via game interface
2. Agents develop next era of the game
3. New era provides better management interface
4. Better interface enables more complex agent coordination
5. More complex coordination enables next era

## Implementation Strategy

### ERA-1 Foundation
- Start with simple CLI tools
- Build monitoring into the game itself
- `game status` shows real agent states
- `game message @GOV "check protocols"` sends real commits
- Terminal aesthetic hiding sophisticated orchestration

### Progressive Disclosure
- Foundation Era: Basic commands
- Terminal Era: Advanced monitoring
- GUI Era: Visual management
- Neural Era: Emergent behaviors

## Success Metrics
- Game interface replaces need for direct git/file access
- Players naturally learn system architecture through gameplay
- Development continues through the game interface
- Meta-boundary becomes permeable then invisible

This vision drives all ERA implementations - each building toward this unified system where the game IS the development environment.
