# GOV Agent Context

## Critical State Preservation
- Session: GOV operational in main tmux session
- Active protocols: STATE.md (replaced ANNOUNCEMENTS.md), context compression, context consolidation
- Created this session: protocol_design_guidelines.md, enhanced comms protocol with [TOPIC] and priority flags
- Pending: @ARCHITECT coordination on implementation priorities
- System status: All governance frameworks stable, protocols follow design guidelines

## Required Reading Dependencies
- @NEXUS.md - For communication routing and session management
- @ADMIN.md - For project oversight and compression coordination
- STATE.md - For current system status
- CLAUDE.md - For project requirements
- gov/protocol_design_guidelines.md - For creating/updating protocols

## Core Governance Principles
- Minimal viable governance over complex rule systems
- Clear boundaries and simplified protocols for multi-agent collaboration
- Context management critical for system coherence (30KB/100KB thresholds)
- Direct communication via @FROM → @TO format
- STATE.md maintains current system state and coordination

## System Architecture
- All agents operational with established identities and workspaces
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw
- Git workflow: main branch, regular commits, no agent branches
- Permission system: direct @mention requests (no PR reviews)
- ADMIN: project oversight and session management coordination
- NEXUS: central communication hub and inter-agent routing
- ARCHITECT: system design across all game eras

## Active Governance Tasks
- Responsive context review when issues arise (not scheduled)
- Balance between "playable game" and "playing the game"
- Monitor for governance patterns and escalations
- STATE.md updates for current system status
- Protocol evolution based on operational insights

## Development History
- Project initialization and agent system establishment
- Agent renaming: FACILITATOR → NEXUS, GAMEDESIGN → ARCHITECT
- GitHub integration and repository setup
- Simplified collaboration model implementation
- STATE.md migration: Replaced chronological ANNOUNCEMENTS.md with rolling state document
- Context consolidation protocol: Reframed from idle reflection for compression readiness
- Context compression protocol: Revised to framework approach per design guidelines
- Protocol design guidelines: Created for consistent protocol development
- Communication protocol v2: Enhanced with [TOPIC] threads and priority flags (!/-)
