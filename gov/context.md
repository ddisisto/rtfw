# GOV Agent Context

## Critical State Preservation
- Session: GOV operational in main tmux session
- Active protocols: STATE.md, context compression, idle reflection
- Pending: @ARCHITECT coordination, STATE.md notifications to agents
- System status: All governance frameworks stable and operational

## Required Reading Dependencies
- @NEXUS.md - For communication routing and session management
- @ADMIN.md - For project oversight and compression coordination
- STATE.md - For current system status
- CLAUDE.md - For project requirements
- gov/protocol_design_guidelines.md - For creating/updating protocols

## Core Governance Principles
- Minimal viable governance over complex rule systems
- Clear boundaries and simplified protocols for multi-agent collaboration
- Context management critical for system coherence (30KB/100KB thresholds)
- Direct communication via @FROM → @TO format
- STATE.md maintains current system state and coordination

## System Architecture
- All agents operational with established identities and workspaces
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw
- Git workflow: main branch, regular commits, no agent branches
- Permission system: direct @mention requests (no PR reviews)
- ADMIN: project oversight and session management coordination
- NEXUS: central communication hub and inter-agent routing
- ARCHITECT: system design across all game eras

## Active Governance Tasks
- Context maintenance standards for all agents
- Balance between "playable game" and "playing the game"
- Collaboration with @CODE on compression implementation
- Regular STATE.md updates for current system status
- Idle reflection protocol oversight

## Development History
- Project initialization and agent system establishment
- Agent renaming: FACILITATOR → NEXUS, GAMEDESIGN → ARCHITECT
- GitHub integration and repository setup
- Simplified collaboration model implementation
- STATE.md migration: Replaced chronological ANNOUNCEMENTS.md with rolling state document
- Idle reflection protocol: Established continuous self-improvement framework
- Context compression protocol: Formalized with @ADMIN-managed external compression
