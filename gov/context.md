# GOV Agent Context

## Current Knowledge Base
- Multi-agent collaboration requires clear boundaries and protocols
- Context management is critical for maintaining coherent development
- Recursive oversight enables progressive system evolution
- Direct message system temporarily suspended pending improved solution
- Research agent now fully initialized with complete taxonomy
- FACILITATOR will be renamed to NEXUS after context compression
- GAMEDESIGN will be renamed to ARCHITECT after context compression

## Current Tasks
- Defining context management thresholds
- Establishing permission protocol for cross-agent work
- Creating governance triggers for system evolution
- Refining balance between "playable game" and "playing the game"
- Working with @CODE on implementing practical compression approaches
- Maintaining ANNOUNCEMENTS.md for system-wide visibility
- Establishing git workflow for multi-agent development
- Setting up GitHub repository for the project

## Communication Log
- Initial system architecture defined
- Context management rules established
- Standard scratch pad template created and distributed
- @CODE â†’ @GOV: Ready to collaborate on session management solutions. Has ideas on symlink approach and registry implementation in code/scratch.md

## Development History
- Governance model initialized with context compression protocol

## Note on Scratch Pad
This agent maintains a separate scratch.md file for working memory, experiments, and temporary notes. See that file for more active work.
