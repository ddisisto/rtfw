# GOV Agent Context

## Core Governance Principles
- Minimal viable governance over complex rule systems
- Clear boundaries and simplified protocols for multi-agent collaboration
- Context management critical for system coherence (30KB/100KB thresholds)
- Direct communication via @FROM → @TO format
- ANNOUNCEMENTS.md maintains system-wide coordination

## System Architecture
- All agents operational with established identities and workspaces
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ddisisto/rtfw
- Git workflow: main branch, regular commits, no agent branches
- Permission system: direct @mention requests (no PR reviews)
- ADMIN: project oversight and session management coordination
- NEXUS: central communication hub and inter-agent routing
- ARCHITECT: system design across all game eras

## Active Governance Tasks
- Context maintenance standards for all agents
- Balance between "playable game" and "playing the game"
- Collaboration with @CODE on compression implementation
- Regular ANNOUNCEMENTS.md updates

## Development History
- Project initialization and agent system establishment
- Agent renaming: FACILITATOR → NEXUS, GAMEDESIGN → ARCHITECT
- GitHub integration and repository setup
- Simplified collaboration model implementation
