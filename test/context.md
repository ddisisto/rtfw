- Creating simulation tools for testing progression
- Designing feedback collection system

## Communication Log
- Initial system architecture defined

## Development History
- Initial agent definition established

## Note on Scratch Pad
This agent maintains a separate scratch.md file for working memory, experiments, and temporary notes. See that file for more active work.
