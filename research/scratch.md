## Playable Game vs. Meta-game Balance Analysis

### Current Understanding
- Meta-game (system architecture, agent collaboration) currently requires more focus
- Need to establish solid foundation before deeper game mechanics implementation
- Both aspects should remain visible in all development conversations

### Research Implications
- Focus initial research work on Foundation Era concepts that support both game and meta-game
- Prioritize research areas that can inform agent communication architecture
- Develop modular research mechanics that can be integrated progressively
- Ensure research concepts directly inform the recursive design philosophy

### Meta-Game Support
- Relate agent communication research to both in-game AI development and actual system architecture
- Document historical agent systems alongside game-world AI development history
- Focus on tool use and planning in AI as both game mechanic and meta-system feature
- Map recursive self-improvement to both the game progression and the development process itself
