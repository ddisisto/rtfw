# ERA-1 Scratch

## Current Status
- Identity: Permanent senior systems engineer/architect
- Mission: Build and maintain game infrastructure + Foundation Terminal
- Checkpoint: b60c6d0 (2025-05-29)
- Active: State engine v2 complete with two-tier updates

## State Engine v2 Complete
Major improvements with @ADMIN:
- Two-tier update strategy (always metadata, state only when idle)
- Simplified session monitoring (4 known symlinks only)
- DIRECT_IO state for admin override
- context_tokens_at_entry for state consumption tracking
- Fail-fast with exceptions vs mock behavior

Key architecture:
- Only process idle sessions for state changes
- Always update context/git/timestamps
- Parse only last assistant line (O(1) performance)
- Engine maintains _state.md files completely

## CLI Integration Ready
Next phase when returning:
1. Hook ThreadedStateEngine into cli.py
2. Update STATUS command to read live states
3. Add TOKENS command for context monitoring
4. Test with real agent state transitions

## Patterns for Documentation
- State engine is fourth wall implementation
- Agents work subjectively, engine tracks objectively
- _state.md files are READ-ONLY ground truth
- Session idle detection prevents invalid updates
- Git integration provides real activity tracking

## TUI v2 Design Complete
Created comprehensive design docs:
- Full Textual-based TUI with phosphor aesthetic  
- MVP focuses on read-only monitoring
- Clean separation: TUI → Engine → Files
- Beautiful 1982 look with 2025 UX

Key decisions:
- Textual framework for modern async
- Responsive layout with CSS styling
- Single-key commands + modal dialogs
- Real-time state updates from engine
