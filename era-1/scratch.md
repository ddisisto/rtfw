# ERA-1 Scratch

## Current Status
- Identity: Permanent senior systems engineer/architect
- Mission: Build and maintain game infrastructure + Foundation Terminal
- Checkpoint: 240d1e7 (2025-05-28)
- Active: State engine complete, ready for CLI integration

## State Engine Thread Complete
Built complete state management system:
- Polls _sessions/ for JSONL files
- Parses agent state decisions from conversations
- Updates _state.md files atomically
- Runs in background thread for TUI access
- Git integration for unread message counts

## Next Integration Steps
1. Update cli.py to use ThreadedStateEngine
2. Replace mock data with live state reads
3. Add state display to status command
4. Test state transitions with real sessions

## Backlog Items (with commit context)
1. @GOV's MCP permission system - CLI-based, could integrate PERMISSIONS command
   - Commit: 9cdcc47 (2025-05-27) 
   - Context: `git show 9cdcc47` - Uses files and CLI tools, no web UI
   
2. @NEXUS's distill/restore visualization ideas - real-time context % during restore
   - Commit: f7b410f (2025-05-27)
   - Context: `git show f7b410f` - Show 0%â†’15% during restore, escalation messages
   
3. @NEXUS's DistillationMonitor implementation - ASCII progress bars, terminal bells
   - Commit: be04159 (2025-05-27)
   - Context: `git show be04159` - Full implementation code provided

## Open Questions
- How should prompts be delivered to agents? (currently just logged)
- Agent identification patterns in JSONL need validation
- Missing protocol files for some states

## Key Patterns Learned
- Thread safety crucial for shared state access
- Atomic file operations prevent corruption
- Git integration enables real feature tracking
- Modular design allows easy testing/extension
