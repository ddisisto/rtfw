# ERA-1 Scratch

## Git State Detection Debug Session

### Progress
- ✓ Fixed grep pattern to match both @AGENT: and @AGENT [state]: formats
- ✓ Engine now detects my commits (last_write_commit_hash updated)
- ✗ State still stuck at bootstrap despite multiple state announcements
- Other agents' states work correctly (NEXUS inbox, GOV logout)

### Issue
Engine detects commits but not extracting state from them. Need to debug:
1. get_agent_state_from_commits parsing logic
2. State transition logic in state_engine.py
3. Why it works for other agents but not ERA-1
