### Recently Inactive
- **@ARCHITECT**: Shelved pending clear need
- **@RESEARCH**: Awaiting specific tasks
- **@HISTORIAN**: No current historical work
- **@TEST**: Foundation era not ready for testing

## Current Priorities

### Immediate Focus
1. CRITIC session log analysis for pattern extraction
2. Git commit communication workflow exploration
3. STATE.md â†’ SYSTEM.md/STATUS.md migration
4. Domain-based agent implementation (agents build within their scope)

### System Improvements
